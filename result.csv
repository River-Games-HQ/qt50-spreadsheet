Everyone is worrying about that. We worry about care homes, of course we do, because we know that, you know, there are logistical issues with this vaccine in terms of the temperature it needs to be. Are we going to make sure we can get to those care homes properly. Then I think there’s a challenge with public health and making sure people know they can trust this vaccine and they should use it. We’re not measles-free in this country any more. We were. We’re not any more because people haven’t trusted the vaccine. So we need a really good public health message. But, you know, this is a really big challenge. The government haven’t got it right on things like test and trace. They have to get it right now because these are people’s lives on the line. We can’t get this wrong again.

[00:04:20] Vaccines mark a major advance in human achievement since the enlightenment into the 19th Century and Britain’s been at the forefront of those achievements over the years and decades. But this isn’t the time for vaccine nationalism. I agree we should congratulate all the scientists, those in Belgium, the States, British scientists working in international teams here in the UK, with AstraZeneca --

Fiona Bruce

[00:04:48] What about the logistical capabilities?

Liam Halligan

[00:04:52] They are obviously forefront now, now we’ve got a vaccine that’s been approved. It’s good -- I’m reassured that the British Army are going to be involved. They’re absolute world experts at rolling out things, complex logistic capabilities. This is probably going to be the biggest logistical exercise that our armed forces have undertaken since the Falklands War, which I’m old enough to remember, just about. So, as a neutral I’d like to see a lot of cross-party cooperation, and I’m encouraged with Sarah’s tone, everybody wants to see us getting on with it now. They don’t want to see competition on whose vaccine is best. There will be some instances where the Pfizer vaccine works better, another where you can’t have cold refrigeration, across the developing world as well, a cheaper vaccine like the AstraZeneca works better. Let’s keep our fingers crossed and hope we make a good job of this.

[00:05:54] What prompted you to ask this? Do you have concerns or what’s behind it? [Coleen]: Well, we haven’t really covered ourselves in glory so far at any logistical exercise. I mean with the PPE, test and trace, any of the things that have had to be done to do with Covid. So, yes, I have got concerns. I also think maybe the government should be managing expectations better. They seem to come out and say everything is going to be done by springtime. I think that’s highly unlikely given the record. I don’t know that a lot has been gained by suggesting that. It will be great if the military is involved. I think it will be much better if the military was involved in the command and control rather than just the delivery side. I hope that’s the case.

But we made it very clear as a government this is a massive logistical challenge, but one that our NHS is up to, the same NHS that got us through this pandemic. Fantastic people, including in my own constituency that worked tirelessly to support us. We have a plan, we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it together, but this isn’t going to happen overnight. We need to be realistic about that. To be successful we need to green-light other vaccinations. This is the first one. It depends on the manufacture of these vaccinations. So it is out of our control as well. It is a long process. Hope and help is here, but there’s a long way to go.[DONE]

[00:07:34] Can I just ask you, the government and Jonathan Van-Tam have been saying today the aim is to get it to care homes first, but there are difficulties with this vaccine because it has to be stored at such a cold temperature so it’s not getting to care homes first. But in Scotland, the Scottish health says care home residents will have it from 14 December. What are they able to do that we can’t?

Michelle Donelan

[00:08:00] My understanding is you can’t break up --

Fiona Bruce

[00:08:04] No, why are they able to do it and we’re not able to do it?

Michelle Donelan

[00:08:08] It is about breaking them up. That needs the approval to do that so you’re not wasting vaccines --

Fiona Bruce

[00:08:16] That’s true for the Scottish government as well. Is what they are saying is not right or --

Michelle Donelan

[00:08:22] I can’t speak to the exact comment. It may be they are banking on the approval coming. We said throughout for a number of weeks now that our priority is care homes and making sure we get that vaccination in there as quickly as possible. We have to do that and we will be doing it as soon as we can.

[00:08:42] Peter, in terms of the logistics, a fantastic breakthrough to have a vaccine, never mind a couple coming down the pipeline. What about getting it out to people?

Peter Openshaw

[00:08:54] This is a tremendous triumph of science that we got this far. I think we are up to the logistic challenge and that’s because we have a system in the NHS that can deliver vaccines at scale. We have tremendous networks which are already present throughout the country. I don’t think we need to put in a whole new command and control system in order to do this because we do have the people already up for this particular challenge. I think the problem about breaking up the batches and getting them out into care homes is an important one. We know the best way to deliver vaccines is at the point where people are assembled in work places, schools, so on. We always know that’s the best way to do it. So I think we must find ways of getting around the logistical problems, which are because of having only four stages that you’re allowed by the regulations to stage this vaccine as it comes from the factory into the delivery points. But I think that is surmountable. It just needs a lot of work.

[00:10:02] From my point of view it has been a magical couple of days, the news that’s coming through. It feels like there’s an end to this nightmare we have all been living. There’s short-term excitement about it, long term there are the problems of getting everybody vaccinated to make sure we can get our lives back to normal and running in that space. Yes, we have a poor track record how we’ve dealt with coronavirus. I have to be honest. You look at the way that the whole thing has been dealt with, you look at the track and trace system, it is something that we have struggled with. There have been bold claims about it and we’re still struggling with this now. So I can understand people’s worry, Colleen’s point of view are we going to fall into the same trap where it comes to rolling out the logistics of this. However, logistics isn’t falling into the tech problem where we’re trying to get everybody to download apps; it is more about getting close to people and resolving it. So, yes, I think if there are the army brought in, if there is people who are all over this have an understanding of how logistics work, it isn’t the same as the track and trace system, so it gives hope that perhaps there is something coming through the other side, that we will, eventually, get something right during this.[DONE]

[00:11:26] Lots of hands. Beth. [Beth]: It has been a difficult year for everybody and I think news of this vaccine is a huge encouragement, the end is in sight. Also it is a very quick vaccine in the fact it has to be stored at -70C, it can’t be kept in the fridge like most normal ones can. Who’s going to be receiving it first in care homes and other facilities that perhaps aren’t geared to catering for this type of refrigeration, that could be an additional logistical challenge. But I think noticing the fact we’ve managed to produce this vaccine, scientists and research managed to produce this vaccine in a matter of months is a remarkable feat. I think the logistical side of it will be realistically easy compared to developing the vaccine in the first place.

It really is a moment to be proud, to be proud of all the scientists across the world working on all these vaccines and to have that light at the end of tunnel, when you are putting up your Christmas decorations you can think there will be an end to this because the vaccine is coming. It is brilliant. We know, and the scientists have been clear in the press conference with the prime minister, this is going to be very challenging logistically. Firstly, how is it going to be delivered and to whom. Of course, there are tiers of people that are going to get it first. But I don’t know about you, but my MP WhatsApp groups have been buzzing all day with people saying we heard there’s going to be a hospital here doing it, a hospital there, but what about our area?

[00:03:28] Thank you. Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca insist there is no shortage of vaccines. There, instead, appears to be a huge blockage in our ability to deploy the vaccine effectively and appears to stem from a lack of joined up planning and a refusal to use all the resources available to us. If Israel can manage 16,000 vaccinations every day, why can’t we do better?

Fiona Bruce

[00:03:58] Why can’t we, Nadhim.

Nadhim Zahawi

[00:04:02] Thank you very much for the question. So, the NHS in England and Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland have put together a delivery plan. We started on 8 December with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a vaccine that has to travel at minus 70 degrees Centigrade. We rolled out into primary care which is the most effective way to get to the most vulnerable, which we were focussing on which is the over 80s. We have now vaccinated 1 quarter, 25 percent of people who are over 80. In two weeks’ time they will have that protection when the vaccine begins to really take effect.

Fiona Bruce

[00:04:58] In terms of the question, could we move faster?

Nadhim Zahawi

[00:05:02] The limitation was actually the vaccine delivery. So with Pfizer/BioNTech we had to hold back 50 percent until the regulator, the MHRA and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the chief medical officers said we could go to a 12-week interval between doses instead of the three-week interval. Now, this week, as of Monday, we got 530,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, and we have millions of doses that will come in the next weeks and months to come. The target we have been set is to do the first four cohorts by middle of February. So stretching target, an ambitious target because you are talking about 13 plus million people who will be the vaccine.

Fiona Bruce

[00:05:58] It is just under 14 million, isn’t it? 13.9. Suzanne, you wanted back in. [DONE]

Right, let's start with our first question which is from Daniel Greening.

Daniel Greening

[00:01:26] Will we be allowed to go on a holiday this year abroad?

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:30] Will we, Vaughan?

Vaughan Gething

[00:01:32] I think it's impossible to say is the honest truth, and that's part of the difficult that we still face now. For all the progress we've made, and it's the hard-won sacrifices that people of Wales has meant we're in a position where coronavirus rates are now under 40 in 100,000, we know that in other parts of the world where we would normally have holidays the rates are rising, so mainland Europe in particular there are real challenges there

[00:01:26] Will we be allowed to go on a holiday this year abroad?

[00:01:30] Will we, Vaughan?

[0:01:14] Hi. Why has it taken until 15 February for the government to impose quarantine at the border. Why haven't lessons been learned from Australia who closed their border in the first wave and now have low levels of infection?

Ian Murray

[0:01:34] It is a great question, a question we have been asking in Parliament for the last year. We're an island nation and most other island nations across the world did better than us because they took the decision early to stop incoming traffic. We had the South Africa strain for 50-odd days. It is only now we take the decision to close down the borders. It's too late. There was a study by Aberdeen University which showed most of the deaths happened because of the inward variants coming in to Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. It seems, again, where both governments have been too slow to react.

[0:03:30] Our first question tonight is from Becky Pierce.

[0:03:36] Sexism, harassment and violence against women continues to present a real and devastating threat to our safety and ultimately to our lives. When we will we learn that this is a problem for society and not a problem for women?

[0:03:52] Becky, we are all absorbing the news about 32 year old Sara Everard who went missing last week. Are you asking this question from personal experience, Becky?

[0:04:04] I am, but also I don't think I know a single woman in my life who hasn't been sexually harassed or experienced some kind of negative attention be it from men, which is really, really saddening. It is just so common. It has almost become accepted. I think that women face real restrictions in their lives and what they can do.

[0:00:00] Was the UK government right to send Royal Navy ships to Jersey amid tensions with French fisherman?

John Bercow

[0:00:10] No, it's an absurd act. Jingoistic sabre-rattling. If you tell me the despatch of those ships and the fact of election day today are unrelated, I can only say that you will believe anything. It is juvenile, it is downmarket, it is not constructive, it doesn't advance the cause of the arguments that need to be resolved. The truth of the matter is the problem flows, as so many things do, from Brexit. It isn't going to be addressed by a kind of Palmerstonian popularism. Frankly, Britain can do better than that.

MATT HANCOCK

[00:15:34] Yes, that is is our proposal. We have a committee that is made up of clinicians and experts that advises me as health secretary in my formal capacity, the joint committee on vaccines and immunisations. This group looks at the data from a vaccine, and they have been working closely with Pfizer and AstraZeneca, and work out what is the best clinical way of protecting most people. They put out an interim recollection, which is that first we should vaccinate people who are in care homes and the people who work looking after them, and then health and social care workers, then come essentially down the age range. For all the different things like obesity that we know has an impact on your vulnerability to Covid, we know age is the single biggest factor by a long stretch. So the answer to your question, yes, we will vaccinate according to clinical priority because that’s how we save the most lives.[DONE]

I would not be in the first tranche but I’m well over 70 now so I would be fairly close to that.

[00:18:02] The priority is all about protecting people according to their risk from the virus. After we have gone down through the over 65s, according to the proposal, opposite the data that we’ve seen, and they may update it as we see more information, then you go to those who are particularly vulnerable from all age groups. After that, down to the over 50s. Once you get below the over 50s, there is less of a clinical justification for any particular ordering. [DONE]

ROSIE JONES

[00:18:46] What do you mean by below the over 50s?

MATT HANCOCK

[00:18:50] So for people who don’t have an illness which makes them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, who are aged between 18 and 50, they are the least likely to die from coronavirus so the clinicians who advise me on this expert panel say they come after all the people who are either older or work in health and social care or who have a particular vulnerability. Unfortunately, we know a lot about who is vulnerable to Covid because of having looked at who has been badly affected.

Those are the two critical things that we’ll look into. [DONE]

FIONA BRUCE

[00:21:28] If people can pay for it, will they get it more quickly?

MATT HANCOCK

[00:21:32] I don’t think that’s going to be possible.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:21:34] Does that mean the government is going to buy up all the doses so people won’t be able to go to a private doctor and say I’d like that. I may not be in this phase, I may not be eligible according to government guidelines, but I’ll buy it so I’ll have it.

MATT HANCOCK

[00:21:48] I don’t foresee this. It has been hard enough buying this as a government. The deals those who develop the vaccine have done has been with government. We have bought on behalf of the whole UK population, then we intend to roll out according to clinical priority.

[00:22:06] Another question from Joe Craft. [JOE]: Is the storage facility in place to guarantee the vaccine?

FIONA BRUCE

[00:22:24] This is difficult. You need the superfreezers. The Scottish government has bought some of these superfreezers. Are you going to be able to pull this off?

MATT HANCOCK

[00:22:34] Yes.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:22:34] You sound very confident. I remember you coming in here and talking about PPE in the first wave.[DONE]

FIONA BRUCE

[00:22:48] You also said we’ll have it sorted by the weekend.

MATT HANCOCK

[00:22:52] And we got there. But on this, the NHS is in charge of distributing it. So the UK government is buying this vaccine and the other vaccines, and it is important we have a portfolio, that we have several. And we are buying them for the whole UK. Then the NHS, in each country, in England, Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland, is responsible for the deployment. It is a challenge. It is incredibly difficult. I would add one more challenge, Joe, you talked about the execution and the storage -- distribution and storage. There is one other part which is in the vaccine Pfizer are doing. But these things are hard to manufacture.[DONE]

MATT HANCOCK

[00:23:46] I’ll come on to that. But you have to think, they are hard to do the science. They are then hard to manufacture. This thing isn’t a chemical that’s made, this biological. Then it arrives and you have to keep it at -70. We have known that for some time too so the NHS has been getting hold of the serious deep freeze. Then you have to distribute it. It will be a huge effort from the NHS. They are supported by the armed services in doing that. Thankfully, the NHS is a very, very significant organisation that reaches into all parts of the country. So the reason I answered, when you said are you ready to do it, it is something we are working on every day. It will be complicated. It will be a huge challenge, but I’m sure that the NHS is up to it. [DONE]

[00:24:44] We need to realise there has been enormous excitement about this vaccine because it is the first evidence that it is a vaccine vaccine-preventible disease. But that doesn’t mean it is going to be the only vaccine. I think what is encouraging, if we also believe the news coming out of Russia, we’ll see a series of vaccines coming through which may have different advantages for distribution. Right now we have to work as if this is the only vaccine that’s going to work but we could have a different conversation in four weeks’ time. I think it comes to this issue of prioritisation. It is a difficult vaccine to get out. There’s about 10 million vulnerable population. If you start vaccinating in January, given that it takes 5 to 6 weeks to get immunity, and you did a million people a week, we wouldn’t get that 10 million vaccinated until way into April, and that’s assuming everybody comes in for their first shot and for their second shot and you are not playing catch-up. So the logistical problem is immense. That doesn’t mean that people should be off the hook, but it is to understand that that challenge is why we need to prioritise the way the vaccine is rolled out.[DONE]

[00:26:00] Are we aware of what other countries are doing in regards to the vaccine? Is there much liaison going on with the World Health Organisation?

FIONA BRUCE

[00:26:22] Let me get a few questions then we’ll won’t put them to Matt and David as well. Marie.

MARIE UNKNOWN

[00:26:28] I was just wondering whether the government foresee any potential supply issues after Brexit at the epidemic of the year and whether that will cause any transportation issues with the vaccine coming into the UK.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:26:42] I think we might come to that point in a moment. I’m going to park that -- “park it”, that’s been one of the big issues. Eammon.

EAMMON UNKNOWN

[00:26:58] I think Matt is underestimating the massive challenges that we’re going to have with the supply and distribution of this product. Because I have seen firsthand with the flu vaccination campaign this flu season, we’ve had massive issues with pharmacies running out of stock, using up their stock quite quickly and not being able to replenish that stock. GP surgeries being out of stock for -- having to wait for more than a month to get new stock in.[DONE]

MATT HANCOCK

[00:27:56] I totally agree with Eammon. As a pharmacist you’ll have seen this. The question I was asked was can we do it. The answer to that is yes, we can.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:28:06] The question is the storage and distribution infrastructure in place to guarantee it.

MATT HANCOCK

[00:28:14] Is this going to be an enormous challenge? Of course. This is going to be one of the biggest civilian operations in history. It will have all the challenges that Eammon set out. But I think that the NHS can rise to them and I think that we can come together and we can help make it happen. So that’s what I’m -- I’m confident that we can make it happen. I’m also highly confident that it will be extremely difficult and one of the biggest logistical exercises this country has ever seen.

[00:29:10] I’m sorry, Matt, but it is a bit facile when you say things like “yes, we can.” The point is we heard there have been problems getting out the flu vaccine this year, and we still have to do more, obviously, because flu runs with us right into the spring. We know that you blew 500 billion on PPE that didn’t work. We know that it’s now nine months and 12 days since the first infection in York and we still, in the sixth richest economy in the world, have not got a successful test, track and trace system. So, in the end this is about public confidence. We need people to believe and to take the vaccine, but I think you’re being asked can you do it given that these freezers, you know -70 are necessary to get this distributed. You can understand why people are nervous that we’re going to be well into the summer before this vaccine is properly rolled out.[DONE]

Would you be happy to take the vaccine?

JAY UNKNOWN

[00:33:26] I’m probably one of the cautious people, to be fair. I’d rather wait and see what the effect is first of all. I mean...

FIONA BRUCE

[00:33:36] So at the moment you’re not sure? Merryn, you wanted in.[DONE]

MERRYN SOMERSET

[00:33:42] I just wanted to say that I’m not -- there is a big trust issue around vaccines and looked at the different surveys you can see that between 7 and 25 percent of people will say they are suspicious of a new vaccine like this. So there does need to be some kind of campaign around the safety and reminding everybody of the efficacy of the vaccines that we’ve had over the last couple of hundred years. It is important to remember back in the 1800s, 20, 30 percent of kids died before they were 5. We put in place a vaccine programme since that has brought that down to one in a couple of hundred. But there is around this idea of trust, trust probably a very simple way to make the general population believe in the vaccine and trust in the vaccine and perhaps, at the same time, to increase a little trust in our politicians, which obviously has fallen off quite substantially over the last 9 months. I would suggest that, Matt, you have the vaccine first, and then every other MP has it, and we can rush it out to a couple of top civil servants as well. We wait two weeks, everything is fine, then you can start rolling it out to everybody else.[DONE]

MATT HANCOCK

[00:35:04] I would take the vaccine as soon as I’m allowed to. We talked about --

FIONA BRUCE

[00:35:10] What about taking it to encourage others?

MATT HANCOCK

[00:35:12] That’s a good question. Because I would be happy to do that. The problem is that would be putting me ahead of the queue in terms of clinical need. Now, because I work in the department for health I count, as it happens, as a healthcare worker. So if my taking it when healthcare workers are allowed to take it, so not jumping the queue, if that would persuade a single other person to take it and give confidence to others, then I’d be absolutely happy to.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:35:44] Should we do a totally unscientific straw poll. Put your hand up in the audience if you think Matt should be one of the first to take it. Quite a lot but not unanimous. Robin, I know because I have spoken to some of our audience members before we came on that quite a few are happy to take the vaccine as soon as they can get it. We heard from John to that effect. Some people are a little bit more worried about it.

ROBIN SHATTOCK

[00:36:12] I think it is an important point. Jay’s position to say I’m going to wait and see what happens, is probably a common response. I think we need to remember that, actually, vaccines, next to clean water, have been the single most effective public health implementation globally. They save saved more lives than any other medicines. People are concerned about this vaccine because they perceive it has been done too quickly. We have done a disservice by saying it takes ten years to make a vaccine. Technology is changing very, very quickly. What has happened is that the same number of participants have been exposed to this vaccine, this particular vaccine, 43,000 participants. When you’re looking at side effects, most side effects occur very quickly, within a week or so of having a vaccine. We would see any severe side effect at this stage. And no regulatory authority, whether it is the UK be medicines regulatory authority or the European Regulatory Authority or the FDA will let anything go through that doesn’t have a totally squeaky clean safety record. [DONE]Now, one thing that I think people completely forget is that a vaccine stimulates your immune system, it tricks it to see if it has seen the virus. So you are getting an aspect of a viral infection that’s so much minor than the real virus. So when you think about the risk benefit, the risk of having a severe outcome from Covid-19 far outweighs any theoretical risk of a vaccine. The problem is vaccines are so successful that diseases go away and all you see is the side effects. Pull out any -- par cell Mo approximately, you probably all had it. Look at the potential side effects of paracetamol. If you never taken it before it would probably scare you to take it but you don’t have the same same because you are familiar with it. I think the way we’ll build confidence is when we roll it out to vulnerable populations, who are desperate for a vaccine to get their lives back to some sort of normality and we see it protecting lives, see it being safe. I’m sure people like Jay will see the evidence speaks for itself.

[00:38:46] Stuart, you have a question.

STUART UNKNOWN

[00:38:48] Good evening, panel. Yes. For those not in the initial bracket to receive the vaccine, will they still need to abide by the social distancing or even face the potential of going back into lockdown as well?

FIONA BRUCE

[00:39:02] How is this going to work? Is there to be a section of the population that can party while everyone else has to wait?

MATT HANCOCK

[00:39:14] Because at first we don’t know whether, even if you had the vaccine you might still transmit the disease, it means we can’t lift those measures on just the people who had the vaccine because you still might give it to somebody else. So what we have to do is vaccinate to protect the most vulnerable and then get to the position where enough people have had it. And we will, of course, monitor afterwards, as we vaccinate the population, to find out the impact on the transmission of the disease. All of this is about how to get life back to normal as fast as possible.[DONE] Another reason to do this, in terms of clinical priority, to your point earlier, the faster we can vaccinate those most vulnerable, the sooner we’ll be able to get life back to normal for everybody else as well. So this is another of those questions that at the moment is unknowable, but the plan to roll out according to clinical priority is the best way to get as fast as possible to as much back to normal as is possible.

MERRYN SOMERSET

[00:40:40] This is a game-changer, the knowledge that there will be a vaccine by the spring and let’s say most vulnerable people and older people have been vaccinated by late spring, etcetera, they think I’m sure the entire economy could open up properly. If businesses know that they can move out of this appalling cycle of not knowing what’s going to happen, hyper regulatory activity, lockdown this, curfew this, rules all over the place, up down, up down, not knowing where they are, if they can look forward to a future that is linear, where things don’t change all the time, then they can start moving their businesses around to make them work again. In that sense it is an absolutely game-changer for business. That’s why you saw these astonishing moves in the stock market on Monday when you saw, effectively all the companies geared into the return of normal life, airlines, pubs, etcetera, go completely -- and all the stocks geared into the nightmare we live now, working from home, etcetera, fall significantly.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:43:26] This is something that came up before a lot of members of the audience.

DAVID LAMMY

[00:43:32] We were told by Boris we would have a deal. We have no deal. We have Boris putting the Good Friday Agreement on the table which jeopardises that deal. We have the chief executive of the Port of Dover saying that a no-deal Brexit could cost us, I think it was a billion a week, and that traffic flows could be down by 40 to 60 percent. The clock is ticking, we’re running out of time, and it is now looking worrying that we’ll have no deal with the European Union. We’ll have no deal, by the way, with the United States of America because we would have risked the Good Friday Agreement by having that no deal. It is desperately important that we get a deal, that it is frictionless trade, that it doesn’t involve tariffs, that we have food safety, health and safety, that we haven’t got queues and lorries backed up and I expect a lot of people in an area like Dover are really worried because a lot of promises were being made. We wait to see what will happen. But we know we now have days -- days -- to deliver this against the backdrop -- just remember, a lot of people were saying look, this is tough. We have all European countries dealing with this pandemic. We have all European countries deal with the economic consequences. Let’s have a little extension while we work this out. No!

[00:45:08] Hold on. Donna, I know there was something you wanted to add to this particular subject as.

DONNA UNKNOWN

[00:45:18] Yes, absolutely. On 1 January 2021, will Dover become a well-oiled gateway to Europe or the biggest car park in the UK?

FIONA BRUCE

[00:45:30] It all plays into the same thing, A, what is going to happen the end of December, but in terms of us getting the vaccine and getting it through Customs is that going to be a problem? Is this something you thought about, Robin? Is this a concern for you?[DONE]

ROBIN SHATTOCK

[00:45:46] I haven’t thought about this in terms of what the immediate priority is. But we certainly realise in the UK, particularly as we go through Brexit, that we need to really ramp up UK manufacturing capacity so that we can make vaccines. And we have cutting-edge technology in this country. I think one of the things that we recognise is that from a pragmatic point of view, we have made -- the government has made purchase of six vaccines, five of those are from overseas. That’s increasing our reliance on overseas production.[DONE]

Now we heard there are going to be vaccines before the end of the year but significantly less than we neat need. Hour many people need to be vaccinated for it to be successful.

[00:13:30] The honest truth to that question is we don’t yet know. It is one of the many things we don’t yet know about the vaccine. The reason for that is in the trials that the vaccines, you test for how effective they are protecting the individual, also how safe they are. If they are safe and effective we can start to roll them out. The early data from the Pfizer vaccine looks like it is 90 percent effective protecting individuals. [DONE] That’s great. So if -- if -- it passes the safety data, and that is a big hurdle it still hasn’t gone over, then we can start rolling it out and it starts protecting people as soon as they’ve -- a week or so after the second dose.

[00:46:24] You are involved in developing a vaccine as well at Imperial College London.

ROBIN SHATTOCK

[00:46:28] We are one of the two UK teams developing a vaccine.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:46:32] Are you getting funding from the government?

ROBIN SHATTOCK

[00:46:36] We are getting government. But it still requires a huge effort for us to build a technology from scratch. To give the kind of examples of the competition, there are 30 R&A companies around the world.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:46:48] This is the particular technology that Pfizer used.

ROBIN SHATTOCK

[00:46:52] It is a new technology that’s at a tipping point. Our direct competition are two companies in Germany, one of which is BioNTech, they got grants from the German government of 350,000,250 million apiece, even though they are well-funded. So we need to think in terms of the strategy as to how we’re going to nurture the vaccine industry, which is more than just start-up, that is sustainable and has a long-term strategic plan.[DONE]

FIONA BRUCE

[00:47:24] Are you getting those kind of funds from the secretary for health here?

ROBIN SHATTOCK

[00:47:30] We are getting support and we fully anticipate that the government will want to see the two flagship programmes are supported to the hilt.

[00:48:00] Antonio?

ANTONIO UNKNOWN

[00:48:02] My question is for Matt. Matt has mentioned that there are several companies, several deals going on regarding the vaccine. I just want to know, these pharmaceutical companies involved will make enormous amounts of money. My question to Matt is this. Does the government have any strategies in place to ensure that these pharmaceutical companies give back to the country from their profits to make sure that everybody in the UK who wants the vaccine can have it, rather than being held to ransom or on what they can produce and what the government wants to pay for the vaccine?

FIONA BRUCE

[00:48:50] Justin.

JUSTIN UNKNOWN

[00:48:54] While this announcement is welcome, does Mr Hancock think it goes anywhere to increasing an apathetic population who have been drip-fed a series of failures, costly failures and double standards?

FIONA BRUCE

[00:49:12] Joe.

JOE KRAFT

[00:49:16] Yes, I think the arguments are given that the NHS will be able to manage the roll-out, the NHS will do it. The NHS relies on subcontractors to do the job of rolling it out. Recently the vetting has suffered and I’ve also heard rumours that there are simply not enough medical grade vials or lorries around or even PPE for the rollout of this vaccine. So to say the NHS will do it, well, the NHS can only do it if they get the support to do their job. So, you know, it would be a monumental waste of money to buy the vaccine and then not having it transported and it becoming ineffective.[DONE]

JOE KRAFT

8:13

FIONA BRUCE

[00:50:12] Lots of different points there. I’m going to drag us back to the original question which came from Andy about confidence about getting the vaccine through post the end of December. We hear all sorts of warnings from road hauliers about not being ready, about holdups at Customs, lorry parks, all the rest of it. Are you confident that that’s not going to be a problem?

MATT HANCOCK

[00:50:44] We have a plan for the vaccine that is being manufactured in Belgium. If necessary we can fly it.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:50:50] That is a lot more expensive than coming through a lorry.

MATT HANCOCK

[00:50:56] The importance of the vaccine can’t be underestimated so we have to plan for all events. Many of the points made some of the points about some of the challenges, like Joe’s point about the fact the vaccine needs PPE, absolutely, that’s a critical part of the plan. So it underlines how this is a hugely complex project but it is one that we’ve we’ve been preparing for for some time.

FIONA BRUCE

[00:51:22] You’re confident that Brexit, if we do leave the European Union without a deal, is not going to hold up the delivery of the vaccine to this condition?

MATT HANCOCK

[00:51:32] I am confident in that. We have a plan, yes.

MATT HANCOCK

[00:52:40] I absolutely think there’s a point, which is that this vaccine that we heard about on Monday, it is good news, but we’re not there yet. And there are still a lot of steps that we need to get through. So I’m only going to reassure you and anybody else as much as I can be confident about.

MERRYN SOMERSET WEBB

[00:54:18] I just wanted to work on reassuring Rosie’s anxieties because I think we’re talking about the vaccine at great length which is interesting and exciting and I hope we’re at the beginning of the end of the whole thing but we’re not talking about the various treatments that have been coming along. While we wait for the vaccine to be rolled out and for everyone to get it there’s a cheap steroid that is working quite well, there’s a UK-based company that is in phase 2 trials on using a drug that is known to be very safe and cheap working in different illnesses that could work well for this and these clinical trials is shown to be. So it is not just about the vaccine; it is also about the fact that we know very good treatments are there, we know that death rates have been falling during the second wave compared to the first wave. We know the mortality rate as a whole is very low and we are learning more about how and where it transmits. I’ll sure we’ll get on whether lockdown is a good idea later, but we know you don’t get get Covid-19 when you’re out shopping. So we are learning we can live our lives whether the vaccine is rolled out or not.

[00:55:30] You haven’t had a chance to answer the question about trying to get the vaccine through if we leave the EU without a deal.[DONE]

MERRYN SOMERSET WEBB

[00:55:38] I think I have to leave that one to Matt because I’m sure there are special arrangements for getting vaccines through very long lorry queues. But I really, really hope that the government has that organised. The wider question is presumably about Brexit and whether there will be long lorry queues in Dover if we go through on WTO terms. The answer to that is there probably will be very long queues in Dover, but there probably will be long lorry queues regardless of whether we have a deal or not because all change that involves lots of pieces of paper and admin and new organisation results in difficulties and holdups and blockages. But that will, I would guess, only last two or three months before we come out the other end. That will be unpleasant for those involved in it but if you believe Brexit is a good thing for the country for a long time, it will be a relatively small price to pay, I hope.[DONE]

[00:56:36] A different question on another topic, from Jay.

JAY UNKNOWN

[00:56:42] Having had a Disability Discrimination Act for 25 years, are we now treating people with more respect and equality?

FIONA BRUCE

[00:56:50] Rosie, I’m not trying to pigeon-hole you here, but in a sense you are the obvious person.

ROSIE JONES

[00:56:58] Why?

FIONA BRUCE

[00:57:00] I can’t imagine. But give us the benefit of your experience.

ROSIE JONES

[00:57:04] The Disability Act came in in ’95. I was 5 years old and, without a doubt, my life has been better because of it. I had an education in a mainstream school. I went to university. I got a job, and with my cerebral palsy have been a successful and independent human being. And I am proud of who I am and I can wee in disabled toilets and park where I want because of this groundbreaking Disability Act. Saying that, 25 years on and whenever I walk in the street alone, I wear headphones because of how I walk and I talk, I get abuse on a daily basis. I am not alone in that. I am not alone in that. I have had times of unemployment. Unemployment is huge among disabled people. I tried to apply for jobs and I have been hung up on because of how I speak. And I’m not alone because right now a quarter of a million disabled people are unemployed and because of Covid, that is rising. [DONE]I was going to say that disabled people are overlooked. But they’re not. They are deliberately ignored because disabled people need more care and more money and I don’t feel like, as a disabled person, I am getting the care and support I need right now.

[01:00:26] Well, I mean, it’s hard to follow that.

FIONA BRUCE

[01:00:28] It is.

DAVID LAMMY

[01:00:30] That was very moving to listen to. Look, I suspect, of course, there’s been progress over the last 25 years, but we’ve got a long way to go. Let me just say, I have three children. One of them has special educational needs and I know the struggle of parents in this country when they’re trying to get a statement. Of course there’s still huge discrimination in employment. I was thinking of the black student dragged out of the union, blind, just a year or so ago. I think there’s a lot to do in this country. We probably have to return to the legislation that’s required. If you look at that story of the 20th Century, it’s a lot of people at the beginning of that century, certainly the disabled, anyone with occasional needs, black and brown people, women, working people, all oppressed in some ways, put down, and by the end of the 20th Century beginning to get their rights. But we are still on that journey. As we go into a deep recession, we know that the people who can be deeply affected are those with disabilities. Let me just say, if you defund local authorities like we have in this country, if you have local authorities like Croydon or Northampton going bust, with big cuts of 50 percent, where is the money for adult social care that the disabled depend on? Where is the money for the kit and equipment that people need in their homes? All the money being cut in day centres right across the country. So it is not a rosy picture. In some ways it feels like a rolling back. I endorse what has been said.

I think the point is in terms of either being overlooked or deliberately ignored is something that society needs to continue to be challenged on. Disability comes in many shapes. Visible disability often leads to abuse but also I’m very conscious one of my daughters has a chromosomal -- she has no physical signs, but it is a hidden problem that people don’t recognise. It is so critical that, like yourself, Rosie, challenge the rest of society repeatedly. The fight needs to go on and we can never be relaxed and not challenge ourselves whether it is disability or any type of prejudice.

FIONA BRUCE

[01:03:24] Merryn.

MERRYN SOMERSET WEBB

[01:03:26] I haven’t much to add to that, except to say from what we hear is obvious that there are not that many families in the UK that aren’t in some way touched by the difficulties of having someone with a disability inside their family. Obviously, there’s a lot more to be done to help everybody with that. But I would also say we mustn’t underestimate how far we have come in the last 25 years. Everybody now understands, which I don’t think they did then, that lack of access to transport, to education, to employment, etcetera, was a travesty and now is considered to be something that everyone should have access to. So there has been huge change over the last 25 years. Obviously, there’s a long way to go but we must remember how far we’ve come as well.

FIONA BRUCE

[01:04:12] I was surprised to learn that rules on public transport, on coaches and buses, come into effect this year, so many years after the Disability Discrimination Act. Huge percent are not accessible.

[01:04:30] I just want to applaud Rosie for challenging you all on that. I want to raise an issue that was mentioned about SDN and children struggling in schools. The delays for diagnosis of difficulties is three years. Covid is going to increase that delay. Disability Discrimination Act gave us us the rights to education. There are lots of children who can’t access education because they are still waiting for a diagnos. What is going to be done about that?

FIONA BRUCE

[01:05:04] Donna.

DONNA UNKNOWN

[01:05:04] I think England it is important remember that any one of us could become disabled at any point in time. So when we’re supporting an increase in access for disabled people we’re actually supporting ourselves, we’re supporting the entire country. So I think looking at this as, you know, as issues that are just for disabled people is just -- I don’t think it is helpful. It is about how do we increase access for all of us, including disabled people. That’s how I think we should look at this. [DONE]

Now we heard there are going to be vaccines before the end of the year but significantly less than we neat need. Hour many people need to be vaccinated for it to be successful.

[00:13:30] The honest truth to that question is we don’t yet know. It is one of the many things we don’t yet know about the vaccine. The reason for that is in the trials that the vaccines, you test for how effective they are protecting the individual, also how safe they are. If they are safe and effective we can start to roll them out. The early data from the Pfizer vaccine looks like it is 90 percent effective protecting individuals. [DONE] That’s great. So if -- if -- it passes the safety data, and that is a big hurdle it still hasn’t gone over, then we can start rolling it out and it starts protecting people as soon as they’ve -- a week or so after the second dose.

[01:05:40] Is it a matter of adding new legislation or becoming a less judgmental society?

MATT HANCOCK

[01:05:46] I admire you so much, Rosie, for the way that you articulate this. I thought what Emily said was so strong, in a small way I have -- I am neuro-diverse, I’m dyslexic. It took me until I was 18 until I was diagnosed. Then I got the support I needed and it made an enormous difference to me. But I was lucky because I was able to get by on my maths and my -- despite the fact that my language skills were very poor, my written language skills, at school. So I felt just a tiny bit of what that feels like. But I think that Daniel’s point is just so important, which is, of course of course legislation is important and that is something we should always be pushing forward, like the change of the buses at the end of this year. I didn’t know about that. It is really important. But how long has it taken us to get to that point. But it is about society accepting everyone and looking for the good in everyone. I think that everyone has something to contribute and we need to go and -- it is our task, our mission is to go and find what is good in people and the contribution they can make and bring it out and support people to do that. So I think there’s a long way to go.

ROSIE JONES

[01:07:28] I think I’d kick myself without talking about the change between the DLA, Disability Living Allowance, to the Personal Independent Payment because 650,000 disabled people, including myself, got caught. And it just makes me insanely angry that I thought when I was assessed in 2008 that money that kept me going, that gave me support, it was taken off me. Luckily, I can work harder. I can push myself. But a lot of disabled people are now on the poverty line because they were assessed by a stranger for 10 minutes who would look at them and go: Oh, what do you need? That makes my blood boil. Yet I want to end it by going stop ignoring disabled people. We make up 22 percent of the population. We’re here and we’re worth listening to. [DONE]

FIONA BRUCE

[01:09:42] Rosie, look at that. If the people here in this studio with us, you’d see the applause. You’d hear it. You can only see it.

Arlene Foster

[00:02:18] The protocol was brought in by Boris Johnson to try to get Brexit done. By doing so, it separated Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom, something we warned about. Since the protocol came in, there have been difficulties with like steel, which we have worked to get sorted out, with pets’ travel, parcels, a whole range of items. We warned the prime minister about this which is why we voted against the withdrawal agreement. We said it was going to cause great difficulties. It arose because of a skewed understanding of the Belfast Agreement. What is really important to Northern Ireland is the trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, both ways. So it is important that we deal with all of the issues in the protocol.

Fiona Bruce



[00:01:10] Our first question tonight is from Blair [Wondin 01:22].



 



Blair Wondin



[00:01:22] Hello. If the main Scottish elections return a full independence government, what moral and legal right does the Westminster government have to deny another independence referendum? 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:01:32] Doug? 



 



Douglas Ross



[00:01:33] Well, I want to stop a pro-independence majority government, I want to stop the SNP having a majority at this election, as the Scottish Conservatives did five years ago. It was by people uniting behind the Scottish Conservatives that stopped that SNP majority in 2016, and people can do that again at this election. 



",Kamila Gorska,3:46,5.5,5,4,1,2,4,1,1,0,699.0,6:56
cutiestestrun29april2021,20970,2,"

























Douglas Ross 



[00:01:50] And I think it’s so important because we’re still coming through the health pandemic, we’re still coming through the effects of COVID-19 that we’ve all been through and the restrictions for the last 12 months. And I really think we need a parliament that is focused only on our recovery, only on rebuilding after the last 12 months that we’ve all been through, rather than one distracted by another independence referendum.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:02:10] And given that Boris Johnson has already said that he will not grant a second independence referendum that’s job done, isn’t it? Why does anybody need to vote for you?



",Christopher Beckett,6:32,7.0,7,5,2,5,7,2,2,2,683.0,12:05
cutiestestrun29april2021,20979,3,"





































Douglas Ross



[00:02:17] Because Keith Brown, as deputy leader of the SNP, launched their 11-point plan for another independence referendum and said they would ignore Westminster; if they didn’t get a Section 30 order, which is the route that was taken in 2014, they would ignore that and hold a wild cat illegal referendum anyway. And that would bring uncertainty when we should be focused on our recovery, and I don’t want that uncertainty in Scotland over the next five years when our parliament has to be focused to protect people’s jobs, to support the NHS, to rebuild our educational standards. All of these things would play second fiddle to a nationalist government who are only interested in separation.

Fiona Bruce



[00:02:49] Do you want that uncertainty, Keith? 



 



Keith Brown



[00:02:51] I want that referendum; and the UK has no authority to prevent that referendum taking place if the people of Scotland vote for that, which was Blair’s question. And I should say on the issue of a wild cat referendum, the wild cat or renegade government in this country is the UK government. They’ve been taken to the Supreme Court, who struck down their decision to try and prorogue the UK parliament; they’ve signed international agreements with the EU which were immediately renounced afterwards; they’ve had ructions going on.



",Xiyuan Gao,11:09,11.5,11,10,1,5,10,1,4,0,675.0,13:14
cutiestestrun29april2021,20978,5,"























































Fiona Bruce



[00:03:19] Yes, but they haven’t done anything wild cat about independence. 



 



Keith Brown



[00:03:21] Well, I think trying to stop parliament from meeting is pretty wild cat to me. And the simple fact is that the people who should decide if there’s a referendum are the people of Scotland. So, I don't think for a second Boris Johnson will continue to refuse to agree a Section 20 agreement. And it will be an agreement, we’re not pleading for that, we want to have that, it’s the best way to have the referendum. But he will not stand in the way of a referendum in Scotland if the people in Scotland vote for it.

Fiona Bruce



[00:03:43] Well, of course he says he will do exactly that. Let’s hear from some of our audience from Scotland – Nirana?



 



Nirana Unknown



[00:03:49] Shouldn’t the Scottish government, I want to ask Keith Brown, take the power focus…focus on power away from it and do welfare to Scottish population, which we need – education, health, industry, unemployment, all these problems are staring in our face. And that’s the reason that the Scottish government, now the SNP, that the people would like to…people don’t want to see another referendum. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:04:25] Okay, Nirana, thank you. Keith, do you want to answer that briefly before I move on?



",Anna Mauz,15:53,6.5,6,4,2,4,6,1,3,0,757.0,11:23
cutiestestrun29april2021,20975,7,"





















































































Keith Brown



[00:04:27] Yeah, if I can. I think this is a really important question and it’s important because this is a really really important election, and I’ve stood in every single Scottish parliament election, this is easily the most important. So, you have two paths. One is if the UK is allowed to go ahead, for example, with the ability to sign trade deals which then start to undermine our NHS. If they default, as Douglas has already done, to tax cuts and austerity as their way to deal with the recovery, that’s not going to suit Scotland.

cutiestestrun29april2021,20971,8,"



























































































Keith Brown



[00:04:47] This is our chance to make our own decisions. And if you don’t exercise power over yourself, somebody else exercises power over you and they do it in their interest and not in your interest. That’s why we have to have the powers to have the right recovery for Scotland.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:05:02] I’ll come to you in a minute, I just want to hear a little more from the audience. Emma?



 



Emma Unknown



[00:05:07] Hi there. I was previously an SNP vote, but basically I feel that your whole manifesto has been overridden by the fact that we want [independence 05:19].

Emma Unknown



[00:05:20] Personally, it’s putting me off being an SNP voter and I’m having to look at other options. I’m actually sat on my postal vote because I don’t really know – how can you convince me that another referendum is in the best interests of the country?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:05:30] Okay. John?



 



John Unknown



[00:05:34] I was curious to ask Douglas Ross – Blair asked a fairly straightforward question and Douglas failed to answer it, as he does so many times, he just went off on a tangent about independence – why don’t you answer the question about if there’s a majority in parliament, isn’t that enough?



",Stephanie Gustedt,15:31,11.0,9,6,3,7,8,4,3,0,755.0,17:55

Douglas Ross



[00:05:54] Well, the question from Blair was about independence, which is why I answered about independence. But we hear from Emma, a former SNP supporter, saying she won’t support the party now because they’re putting independence above our recovery. What I’m saying as a Scottish Conservative is, we can stop that, we can stop the uncertainty and focus on jobs…



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:06:12] Okay, you’ve made that point. 



 



Douglas Ross



[00:06:13] …focus on recovery, focus on education, all the things we want to focus on in the next parliament.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:06:16] Willie? 



 



Willie Rennie



[00:06:16] Yeah, I mean, this country has been bitterly divided for, what, ten years now with arguments over independence, then over Brexit and we’ve been through one hell of a year with the pandemic.

Willie Rennie



[00:06:25] I agree with Nerinda when she says that we need to focus on the people who are waiting, for instance, over a year to get mental health treatment; people who have lost out on education for the last year. What we need to do is to try and bring the country together; we won’t get that with these two parties who are determined to feed off each other and the [bitterness 06:46] that’s grown up over that period. What we need to do is to try and bring people… 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:06:48] And why do you think more people aren’t listening to your message?

cutiestestrun29april2021,20989,12,"









































































































































































Willie Rennie



[00:06:51] Well, what we need to do is to try and bring people together because we’ll need the skills and talents of everyone in this country to get through this recovery. We won’t do that if the country is divided by independence. And that’s why I think it’s most interesting that there are SNP supporters, and I’ve come across many of them, who are just sick to the back teeth of the divisions and they want to come together for a change. We can put aside our differences for the next five years to try and unite the country to get through this recovery; we owe it to these people to do exactly that.

Lorna Slater



[00:07:21] The unionists want independence, the question of independence, to go away. Of course you want us to forget about independence and think about bringing the country together, but you can’t sweep it under the rug.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:07:31] Or concentrate on the recovery, which is what they want.



 



Lorna Slater



[00:07:33] Thanks to the Scottish Greens we have had a parliamentary majority for independence all these last five years, and I fully expect that, thanks to the Scottish Greens, we will have a parliamentary majority for independence this next parliamentary term. So the question is…



",Mascha Graupe,10:52,7.5,7,7,0,4,6,4,0,0,815.0,8:42
cutiestestrun29april2021,20977,14,"

































































































































































































Willie Rennie



[00:07:46] What an arrogant assumption, to assume that you’re going to win the election before anybody’s voted. 



 



Lorna Slater



[00:07:48] So, the question is, what does that mean for who gets to decide on the recovery? So, we’ve seen what, for example, Boris Johnson considers recovery – more nuclear weapons, a tiny one per cent pay rise for nurses that’s essentially a tax cut. And very…you know, Rishi Sunak doesn’t say it on the telly but eight per cent cuts to public services. That is not recovery; that is grinding austerity, more grinding austerity.

cutiestestrun29april2021,20983,15,"













































































































































































































Lorna Slater



[00:08:00] For recovery there has to be investment, there has to be hope and opportunity, and that means looking at what kind of country we want to be and who gets to make the decisions about that country. And I think it’s time we asked the people of Scotland again, who makes those decisions – the Brexiteer Tories in London or a government in Scotland that we’ve actually voted for? 



 



Anas Sarwar



[00:08:36] I think what you’ve seen already tonight is a preview of what could be the next parliament – we can choose something different. We can choose to recognise that COVID didn’t choose between yes no, leave and remain; the aftermath is not going to choose between yes no, leave and remain.

Anas Sarwar



[00:08:45] And whilst we’ve been separated from our families like never before, we’ve actually come together as a country like never before to confront COVID. And one of the things that I think is missing, particularly from the SNP and the Tories, is they somehow want to ignore the fact that this isn’t an ordinary election. This is a pandemic election when 10,000 of our fellow citizens have lost their lives, when 360,000 of our fellow citizens are on furlough…



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:09:11] But what will you do, Anas, if this election does return a pro-independence majority, will you just ignore that? 



 



Anas Sarwar



[00:09:17] Well, that’s why, Fiona, I’m offering something different. I want us to choose something different…

And I know that people will make the case that things have happened since then, but we were told at the time it was a one in a generation vote, and we voted and we voted to stay part of the United Kingdom.

[00:13:39] Nerinda mentioned at the very start about focusing on the independence referendum, or building the economy and recovering the health service. To me they’re not mutually exclusive. We can still have an independence referendum and still focus on these areas. SNP has seen a huge rise in NHS spending. We’ve the most GPs, nurses, midwives, dentists and NHS staff per head across Britain. We have the best performing accident and emergency units, we have free prescriptions and eye tests. So, to me they are not mutually exclusive, we can still have an independence referendum and we can still focus on these key priority areas.

Willie Rennie 



[00:14:35] So, Fiona, let’s take the issue of drugs. Scotland’s got a terrible record on drug deaths – 1,256 people died, it’s the worst in Europe, in fact it’s the worst in the developed world, it’s three and a half times what it is in England. And the confession from the First Minister was that through the independence debate she took her eye off the ball. And we know from the previous Justice Secretary that they didn’t want to deal with the issue because it was too difficult and it might repeal people from voting for independence at the time. Now, that’s what we could have multiplied in the next five years. If the SNP, and the Greens, allow us to have a parliament that’s focused on independence, many many other things will be neglected. More people will die. This is real people’s lives. We need to focus on dealing with the massive challenges we’ve got.

Willie Rennie 



[00:15:00] We’ve got a climate emergency, we’ve got NHS waiting times that are as long as your arm, we’ve got an attainment gap that is as wide as ever. And we’ve got mental health waits, people waiting an age, young people waiting for a year, it’s appalling. That’s what we should be focusing on. We’ve got enough on our plate without arguing more about independence. Let’s bring everybody here together. There are a lot of talented people in the parliament that could actually resolve things. We did it through the pandemic; we did some tremendous cross-party work on dealing with a massive challenge. I want more of that rather than more of the division that is inevitable even with the best of intentions of having a debate that’s fruitful. We will have divisions and the divisions will lead to us taking more eyes off more balls and more people will lose their lives. This is very serious and we do need to focus.

Douglas Ross 



[00:16:25] Scotland was once a world leader, it’s now internationally average for education. And all these things we can do if we don’t have the threat of a referendum hanging over us. And I’d just say to Keith, what do you think, tonight, listening to Emma, as a former SNP voter, saying the SNP are only focused on another independence referendum? That’s after 14 years you’ve been in power – you’re offering nothing new to the people of Scotland other than more division with another referendum.

[00:16:53] Absolutely untrue [voices overlap16:54]. 



 



Douglas Ross 



[00:16:54] But that’s what Emma’s saying. 



 



Keith Brown 



[00:16:56] If I can just answer the question, Douglas. If Emma would like to look at the manifesto, she’ll see there is a mention, of course, of the referendum because we do think it’s crucial to how we actually get through the pandemic. But the national care service, the increased funding for the NHS, the baby box continuing, the fact that we’re going to have free school males for every child…and breakfasts and lunches for every child in primary school. There’s a whole host of other stuff in there.

[00:18:12] Right, okay. 



 



Keith Brown 



[00:18:10] And if you go back to the point that was made about the question of Brexit, in the referendum of 2014 we were told the only way to guarantee Scotland’s place in the EU was to vote no. Well, people voted no and it’s been changed, we’re being dragged out of the EU against our will. But that’s also one of the routes that we can have back to prosperity, a more equal and just country, if we get back into the EU and with the powers of on independent country.



 



Anas Sarwar

Lorna Slater 



[00:23:55] Our turbine launched today, it was excellent, the largest turbine in the world launched today from Dundee, it’s on its way to Orkney. And this is how we manage the decline of the oil and gas industry; to tackle the climate emergency, to meet our legal requirements under the Paris Agreement, the oil and gas industry must decline.



But that does not mean that we have to inflict hardship upon the people who work in that industry. 



The Scottish Greens would see a jobs guarantee for all oil and gas workers, to make sure that they have jobs to move to in renewable industries, in other subsea industries. Scotland has 25 per cent of all of Europe’s offshore renewable energy. We have a huge amount of potential there and I know that workers like yourself would be excited to work in a sustainable industry, an industry that has a long future, an industry that is on the cutting edge. And like with the turbine launch today, Scotland is on the cutting edge of renewables and we would welcome you to come and join our industry with us, and let’s work together to build a sustainable future for Scotland.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:24:54] So, you’ve hitched your wagon, not officially but nonetheless you are supporters of the SNP in government. The SNP are not pledging to phase out fossil fuels within ten years – so are you putting independence before climate change? 



 



Lorna Slater 



[00:25:11] So, we have no formal relationship with the SNP. We happen to agree with them on independence but actually on many other policies there is a lot of… 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:25:17] You supported their budget and you’ve supported them in parliament.



 



Lorna Slater



[00:25:19] Every party has the opportunity to negotiate the budget.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:25:22] I’m just checking, is independence more important to you than climate?



 



Lorna Slater



[00:25:26] The climate is the most important thing, absolutely the number one thing. We have nine years left to make fundamental changes to how our society and economy works. And you’ll see in our manifesto that it is a plan for a fair and green recovery from the pandemic. We feel that independence is an important question to ask because in order to implement the full suite of changes we need to build the economy we want, we can do more with independence.

Fiona Bruce



[00:25:50] Okay, no, you’ve made that point, so… 



 



Lorna Slater



[00:25:52] We can do more with independence but that also doesn’t mean we can’t do more with the powers that we’ve got. Willie is right to some extent when he says we could do more. Those things can both be true.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:26:00] Okay. Are you also going to pledge them to phase out fossil fuels within ten years? 



 



Keith Brown



[00:26:05] No, I think, to go back to Alan’s question, back in 2013-14 when there was a real crisis in the oil and gas sector in Scotland, with a plummeting price, we instituted a number of revisions which allowed people to train out of those jobs into other jobs for that period. And I think what we now have to do is to ensure what people call a just transition so that people that are actually working in that industry can find a way through into new employment opportunities. So we would pledge to do that and also I think we…



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:26:28] And so, when do you intend oil and gas production to stop, Keith? 



 



Keith Brown



[00:26:31] Pardon? 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:26:32] When do you intend it to stop? 



 



Lorna Slater



[00:26:33] That’s a good question. 



 



Keith Brown



[00:26:34] Well, I do think it’s very important that we should explore other avenues as well, so for example, carbon capture twice could’ve been started by the UK government and they pulled the plug on it.

Keith Brown



[00:26:40] So, there are things we can do to address the effects of taking those hydrocarbons out of the ground but eventually we’ll have to stop. Lorna’s right, climate change is an existential threat to the planet – we have to deal with this. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:26:52] So when do you think…? 



 



Keith Brown



[00:26:52] We should not be doing it at the expense of people that are currently in that industry and, whatever we do, we have to look after the families and the people involved there. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:26:58] Well, do you want to give us a timeframe, Keith, give us your plan? 



 



Keith Brown



[00:26:59] Well, I can’t say specifically when it’s going to stop, it will depend on the supply that’s there just now of course. 



 



Lorna Slater



[00:27:04] So, there you see one of the massive gaps in policy between where the SNP and the Greens are. So, we need to actually be practical about our obligations under the climate…under the Paris Agreement and to, you know, deal with this existential threat. And this is a problem that I have with the SNP approach of setting targets and putting their hopes in things like carbon capture when actually there are already practical technologies that work. Upgrading our rail system, investing in renewable technology and upgrading our homes are all things we can do to reduce our emissions right away, no need to wait.

Douglas Ross



[00:27:36] Lorna said, Alan should be excited about the opportunities that the Greens would provide to him and his colleagues. And I didn’t get from Alan’s question that he was particularly excited about what the Greens would do in this next parliament and the next two parliaments to shut down production of oil and gas in the North Sea. Scottish Conservatives have been very clear, we want to protect the more than 100,000 jobs in Scotland that rely on that sector. The fact that… 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:28:00] Well, though, in your manifesto, you say… 



 



Douglas Ross



[00:28:01] Sorry, I just want to quickly say… 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:28:02] You say, the North Sea oil and gas has a long future decades ahead. 



 



Douglas Ross



[00:28:05] Yes.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:28:06] Yet today you know there is a huge global climate summit.



 



Douglas Ross



[00:28:07] Of course. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:28:09] And you had Boris Johnson pledging to a big cut in carbon emissions – how are you going to keep those two things going in tandem?



 



Lorna Slater



[00:28:16] It’s totally incompatible.



 



Douglas Ross



[00:28:16] Because the UK government has committed to a transition deal with the oil and gas sector – £16 billion to work with the experts and the people who have trained in oil and gas over decades, to transition to greener forms of renewable energy.

Douglas Ross



[00:28:21] It’s a first in the G7, but also Deirdre Michie was writing in the P&J earlier on this week about the Green plans, and it’s not just the 100,000 jobs in the North East and in Scotland, it’s 270,000 livelihoods that rely on the oil and gas sector here in Scotland. And that’s what we’ve got to protect and that’s what Scottish Conservatives are doing with our plans.



 



Lorna Slater



[00:28:49] That’s our way of planning to get 200,000 new jobs. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:28:51] Okay, we hear you and we’ve heard lots from you, Lorna, thank you very much. Let’s hear from you, George. 



 



George Unknown



[00:28:55] Hi. I grew up in Aberdeen so in 2014 the oil crash I saw the impacts of it myself. And it was quite disastrous to the city as a whole because even jobs which aren’t directly in the oil industry get lost due to just the crash and no money in the city. So if we don’t do a transition now, or at least have a plan to transition into a greener economy, we could risk jobs which could be saved if we act now. And in general, I would say everyone on the panel you were all arguing, like, back and forth for independence but for climate change there’s less shouting. So it’s more positive to see but we just need to continue this into actual action rather than just words.

Fiona Bruce



[00:29:35] Jo? 



 



Jo Unknown



[00:29:39] Yes, I just echo that. I think that this transition from oil and gas is inevitable so why are we not looking at retraining and upskilling people into renewables now rather than waiting for the inevitable to happen? 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:29:55] Ruth? 



 



Ruth Unknown



[00:29:55] Yeah, absolutely. What I do see is that there is a gradual training, which is a damn sight more than the Tories did when the pits closed. I saw precious little training going on for the thousands of miners who just got put out and hung out to dry, you know, I didn’t see any Tories screaming about that.



 



Douglas Ross



[00:30:15] Well… 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:30:15] I’ll come back to you a minute, Doug, but let me just get round the rest of the panel. So, Labour’s plans in terms of phasing out oil and gas, you’ve made no particular pledges on that? 



 



Anas Sarwar



[00:30:23] Well, look, we can only truly talk about a just transition if it takes communities with us, and if we decimate tens of thousands of jobs without a genuine transition to renewable jobs that’s not going to be a fair transition or a just transition.

Anas Sarwar



[00:30:30] But there’s actually a wider North East economy point here, because Aberdeen in the surrounding areas is facing a crisis around oil and gas but it’s also got a crisis around the hospitality industry and a crisis around the tourism industry. There is a real economic crisis in the North East and this is one of the reasons why recovery is so important. When we talk about recovery it just can’t be a campaign slogan, it has to actually be a national mission. And the North East is a perfect example of that. Unless we push power and resource out from our parliament into the different parts of Scotland so they can invest in individual sectors, for example, the renewable industry... 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:31:08] Yeah, but Anas, in fairness, I know this is what you want to make in terms of your manifesto but the question is very specifically, how do you view the long-term future of oil and gas workers? 



 



Anas Sarwar



[00:31:16] Well, the long-term future has to be one in which we transition to a renewables future, but we’ve got to start that hard work now.

[00:31:37] We keep hearing about the Saudi Arabia of renewables, we heard it from Alex Salmond before, we’ve heard it from Boris Johnson now, we’re hearing it now from the Scottish government again.

And that work is not happening and [voices overlap 31:41] was a perfect example of that.

[00:31:44] Eighty per cent of our fuel is fuelled by renewables.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:31:43] Okay. Willie? 



 



Willie Rennie



[00:31:46] So, what we need to do is we need to reduce the demand for oil and gas. That means making sure we change the heating in our homes. So, we want to convert from gas the heating in our homes to things like air source heat pumps and other renewables. We want to make sure we have district heating systems that uses hydrogen; also hydrogen for transport. We need to make sure the tremendous potential we’ve got off the shore and Lorna’s talked about it already, with the wind farms, the great opportunities there, a huge resource.

Willie Rennie



[00:32:00] We need to make sure we exploit that potential as well. And if we reduce the demand there won’t in time be the need for the oil and gas reserves that we have in the North Sea. But then we’ll have created the jobs, the thousands…thousands and thousands of jobs will be created populating all that work to make sure that we can reduce that demand. That’s the step by step way.



It’s the hard graft that needs to be done in order to make sure that we can make this just transition real, because we can’t afford to do a repeat of the 1980s where we just left communities in the lurch. The one, in fact, that I leave in was left in the lurch with thousands of people unemployed for years on end, scarred for life – that cannot be done again. So we need to have this transition, and the transition is done by reducing demand, by using the new technologies to make full use of tremendous resources and the skills and the talents of people here. We should be able to create a massive number of jobs if we do this right. A cavalier approach will not [voices overlap 33:17].

We are taking them with us, with the UK Government’s £16 billion transition deal to make sure that goes further to protect the jobs. But it’s absolutely vital that people understand that’s already happening in the North East and across Scotland right now because it’s being led by the sector, by the Oil and Gas UK and by people like Alan who are doing the work right now.

Fiona Bruce

[00:34:08] No, look, what we’re saying is that we have a national recovery plan so we’ve deliberately [slitched 34:16] our manifesto into two parts and made it a recovery plan rather than a party manifesto, it’s a recovery plan for our country. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:34:20] But you’ve only provided costings for the first year so how can anyone actually work out how you’re going to find the money for the whole term?

[00:34:25] No, so what we’re saying is that the investment we need to make immediately in the economy, and immediately around our public services, needs to happen on day one. We can’t wait for the virus to disappear before we start planning for our national recovery.

[00:39:28] We’re not talking about taking pounds out of ordinary people’s pockets, we’re not talking about increasing taxes on your work. In fact, we believe that for the economy to function well we have to put money into people’s pockets. And that’s why we would support things like a universal basic income, for example, helping with child payments. So, this is about the very very wealthy paying a little bit more, not ordinary people. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:39:49] So, Doug, you want to cut business rates and lower taxes. 



 



Lorna Slater



[00:39:54] For the rich. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:39:55] How are you going to pay for everything, where’s your magic money tree?

[00:39:59] So, Doug’s point is crucial because Scottish Conservatives are the only party in this election who, with our manifesto, published our full spending commitments. We have set that…

Keith Brown



[00:40:21] That’s just a nonsense. 



 



Douglas Ross



[00:40:20] So, that’s typical fancy economics from the SNP. But in terms of our plans, it’s focused on recovery, it’s focused on investing, it’s focused on supporting the NHS. IFS say the Scottish Conservative plans are the most generous for the NHS out of all the parties in this election. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:40:34] But where are you going to get the money from?



 



Douglas Ross



[00:40:36] So, what we’re saying, for example, there’s £4.8 billion of unallocated capital spend in the Scottish government at the moment. We need to get that money out – so that drives our infrastructure growth right across the country, be it full fibre broadband, be it, you know, investing in more house building, the most ambitious social housing building programme since devolution that the Scottish Conservatives are putting forward.

[00:41:26] Hello. Douglas Ross, I’m struck by the various areas that you say for investment, but I don’t hear you talking about people, I’m not hearing you talk about communities. The people who’ve been the most hit, I would say, are the disadvantaged. We’re expecting a huge homelessness spike and a peak – how would you, kind of, see that the investment where you’re going to place it is going to respond to any of these issues?

Willie Rennie



[00:42:00] And cut universal credit [voices overlap 41:59]. 



 



Douglas Ross



[00:42:00] That’s why we want to roll out full fibre broadband by 2027, because one of the biggest things that we’ve seen during this pandemic is people not being connected with friends and loved ones. Why are we still in 2021 struggling with good Wi-Fi signals in many parts of Scotland? That’s the type of investment that can connect people and communities all over again.

[00:43:21] Probably about £137 million. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:43:23] Where’s that going to come from? 



 



Keith Brown



[00:43:24] That’s going to come from the budget that we have. Willie mentioned before that the basis for drawing up budgets in the Scottish government is a central…an optimistic, if you like, and a less optimistic estimate. We’ve taken the central estimate, as Willie appears to have done, to calculate. So you know the money that’s going to come in from Scottish taxpayers giving money to the UK Exchequer and the money we get back, and also from the Scottish taxation system which is both more progressive and less onerous than the UK system. But if I can come back to Douglas’s point, he said that his is the only costed his manifesto – he couldn’t answer the question where the £600 million of cuts in the NHS was going to come from.

Fiona Bruce



[00:45:35] Right, so Keith, I know you want to come back. Willie, I’m going to start with you. You’ve talked about drug deaths already, let’s look at those in the NHS.



 



Willie Rennie



[00:45:41] So, at the core of this we’ve got a mountain of mental health needs, we’ve got a mountain of people who are waiting for their operations, their appointments. And what we need to do is to use some of the new technologies and new ways of working that we’ve developed through the pandemic, to make sure that we can deal with this backlog as quickly as possible. We’ve got two and a half billion pounds of extra funding that’s going to be committed to the NHS over this period, and that means we’ll have the finance.

Willie Rennie



[00:46:10] But at the heart of this, we need to deal with the problem that pervades much of the public services, which is our mental health problem. We’re not training any more psychiatrists and psychologists than we did five years ago. We need to have mental health first-aiders in every single work place so we can reduce the demand on the NHS. We also need to make sure that we’re deploying the mental health counsellors that are in the community to be able to take the load off there as well. So, that will help significantly.



We also need to localise health services because people have got used to health services being much more local, whether it’s using the technology or in their local centre. We need to make sure that the specialists are available at a local level, again, to reduce the demand, to do the preventative work, so that we can actually get the NHS back on track. This has got to be one of our top priorities because we need to invest in our NHS to make sure people get the treatment that they need on time.

Fiona Bruce



[00:47:16] So, Jude’s question, Keith, is is the NHS in Scotland ready for the task ahead? Just looking at the funding again, you know, we’ve got the election coming up, obviously – why are you promising a smaller increase in funding than the UK government?



 



Keith Brown



[00:47:29] Well, we’ve said, very similar to what Willie just said, two and a half billion pounds. And I think it’s also true to say we start off from a higher per head expenditure on health services in Scotland.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:47:38] But, so why are you promising a smaller increase in funding?



 



Keith Brown



[00:47:40] Well, but what we’ve also said is, if there are further consequences that come, we will allocate that to the health service. So I don't think it’s possible to be definitive over what the UK does from a lower base compared to what Scotland does, and as the point that was made earlier…

Keith Brown



[00:47:55] Well, there is actually. If the consequential…



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:47:58] Well, it’s 2.1per cent versus 3.4per cent.



 



Keith Brown



[00:48:01] Well, I think those figures are disputed, the UK figures are disputed by experts. But if we put the two and a half billion pounds which I mentioned, and anything in addition to that, there are consequential monies, then it could be the case that the increase is even greater. Plus, as Willie rightly says, we also have an additional commitment to mental health services. And also, to the point he made about a link worker, for example, in every health centre. So, there are additional expenditures. And what we what to do is, by the time of the end of the next parliament, have one tenth of the entire NHS budget going towards mental health because of some of the problems.

Pippa Unknown



[00:48:40] Yeah, that’s right. I think it was referenced earlier the idea of a national care service. And my experience over the last year is that that’s one of our main problems, not having safe and available places to discharge elderly and frail patients to. They’re not always benefiting from acute admissions to hospitals and then they get a bit stuck and in hospital they’re at risk of hospital carried infections, including COVID. And I think that’s got to be one of the main points for discussion when we’re discussing moving the health service in Scotland forward.

There is a tsunami of conditions that are coming our way. I work particularly in Alzheimer’s disease. And Alzheimer’s disease was a leading cause of death in the UK up until COVID took over, but recently, with the decline in COVID deaths, Alzheimer’s disease has once again taken that unfortunate top spot.



But there’s a number of diseases, whether it’s chronic neurological diseases or neurodegenerative diseases, the consequences of cardiovascular disease, which are still growing, cancers which are still an issue. And then we’re dealing with the mental health issues and we’re also dealing, on top of that, with the diseases that haven’t been adequately treated during the COVID pandemic because some many resources have been directed towards COVID.

[00:52:07] Okay. I need to get round the rest of the panel, Anas, forgive me or they won’t have time. Doug?



 



Douglas Ross



[00:52:11] So, our NHS staff and social care staff have gone above and beyond over the last year, and they’re going to continue to do so. And what we’ve heard from both Judith and Pippa…

Fiona Bruce



[00:52:18] So, why did you refuse to back the SNP proposal of a four per cent increase in the NHS pay? I mean, you’ve now done a U-turn, I think, and you now do support it.



 



Douglas Ross



[00:52:25] No, it was never a U-turn, we were being asked totally different questions. But we are clear that we…



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:52:29] Well, you said you’d wait for the pay review, there hasn’t been a pay review but you do now support the four per cent?



 



Douglas Ross



[00:52:32] Absolutely – support the four per cent, but it’s still out for consultation and it’ll be after the election before we understand the outcome of the ballot that will be taken on that.

Douglas Ross



[00:52:40] But we do have to support our NHS and social care staff because it’s not just the last year that’s been so difficult, the next year is going to be really difficult. That’s why we want to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in the next year to catch up because people were waiting a long time for appointments and operations before COVID hit. And many of them were just getting ready to go into hospital for urgent operations, hip replacements, just as COVID hit and now they’ve been left another year waiting. And I say again, the IFS has said the Scottish Conservative plans for the health services and funding for the health service are the most generous in this election because we can see that’s where the priority is.

[00:53:19] That’s why you have tax cuts.



 



Douglas Ross



[00:53:20] That’s where the priority is for everyone speaking on the call tonight because they want to get us to catch up on operations, on treatments that have been missed, on appointments that have been delayed, and that’s why we need to invest over the next year.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:53:30] Lorna?



 



Lorna Slater



[00:53:31] I think Judith described very clearly three of the long-term trends that we’ve seen in healthcare in Scotland and indeed in the UK that I think are concerns – increase in mental health problems, problems with not having care places to put people in that have, you know, led to the sort of bed blocking and that kind of problems; and chronic health problems that we see that really are a result of poverty and inequality.

Lorna Slater



[00:53:50] So, we’ve all talked about the, kind of, acute issues, addressing the immediate issues of COVID. But let’s also look at the bigger picture and look at restructuring our economy because those are all things we can do something about.



We can work together cross-party to build a national care service to stop that bed blocking, to lift the pressure on the NHS. We can work together to alleviate poverty in Scotland, to implement fair policies, living wages, a universal basic income, affordable housing so that people don’t suffer from that kind of grinding poverty. And things like reliable income, you know, fair work, knowing that you’re going to have the money at the end of the month to pay the bills – that goes a long way to alleviate the kind of mental health crisis that we do see in Scotland.

Lorna Slater 



[00:54:45] So, alleviation of poverty goes a long way to doing those things, you know, good work, fair wages, all these things go a long way to that, and so will the national care service. All of this is part of rebalancing our economy, and I look forward to getting to work on it.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:54:56] Okay. Jude, you asked this question, what do you think of what you’ve heard?



 



Jude Unknown



[00:55:01] Yeah, I would welcome, of course, any solid investment and commitment to community-based rehabilitation services. I think the investment is a genuinely important element. I also think we should be aiming for a joined up approach across acute services and community services.

Jude Unknown 



[00:55:14] We need to have a multi-professional approach to this and we need to really support these patients right across their journey of rehabilitation. The 2009 NICE guideline tells us that we need high-quality rehabilitative services for any patient suffering a serious illness, and that includes COVID. And I believe that we have the staff, allied health professionals, we have these staff with the skills to be able to work across a range of…to meet a range of patients’ needs, including physical and mental health. And I feel we just need that joined up approach but also the investment that comes along with it.

Fiona Bruce



[00:55:56] And Lynne, you’ve had your hand up throughout.



 



Lynne



[00:55:59] I actually was going to say something very very similar. I get really frustrated listening to politicians talk about what Health needs and to quote statistics and figures. I work with young people and I can’t echo more the need to see health holistically tied up with that whole development of people, especially young people. How many problems and health issues could we prevent in the years to come?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:56:24] And do you think you’re seeing that from any of the politicians you’ve got here today?



 



Lynne



[00:56:29] I’m disappointed, if I’m honest, I’m disappointed.

[00:56:37] Yeah, I would just say that I just find it, kind of, not overly surprising but just amazing that the same people who have for the last year voted for these really tight restrictions on our civil liberties and freedoms then discuss how they’re going to fix the problems that have been caused by those laws in place. And I know that the response will probably be that we’d no alternative but this has been a year now, we’ve had a year to really think about things.

[0:00:14] Thank you. There was a very clear imperative for the west, NATO, to initiate the action in Afghanistan. The attacks on the world trade centres were devastating, British people lost their lives of course, as well as the Americans, and Al-Qaeda was being harboured in Afghanistan, so the initial entry was to prevent Al-Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base of operations, and that initial mission was a success.

[0:00:48] So why did we fail on the exit strategy? That is Rita's question.

[0:00:48] The first question is from James alcock.

Audience Member A

[0:00:58] Why can you sit on a beverage on 8 March for a drink with a friend but you have to wait 35 days later to do it outside a licensed pub or restaurant? Social contact is no different. If anything, it's safer. Why are we waiting.

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:16] What's your feeling about this?

Audience Member B

[0:01:24] The social contact is no different. As much as I believe the British public want to do the right thing, the reality is, as an operator, I'll manage that for you, I'll make sure you're safe, that's what we do, we're experts in safety. If the guidelines are there to make sure people are 1.5, 2 metres apart, I'll do that for you. To make people manage that themselves, it is difficult.

[0:00:00] Is the European Union having its sausages and eating it?

Fiona Bruce

[0:00:04] Lucy, we're talking about the Northern Ireland protocol.

Lucy Powell

[0:00:12] The issue is that the Northern Ireland protocol is a direct consequence of the type of Brexit that Boris Johnson and this government wanted to have. They didn't want to be part of the Customs Union or the single market or the other options and they don't want to align on food standards and veterinary standards which, if they were to align with the EU, which is what Biden is asking them to do, that would reduce many of the issues that we're seeing around the Northern Ireland protocol.

[00:00:00] Our first question from Tim.

AudienceMember 20210610QT01

[0:00:04] Good evening. The government is committed to 1.4 billion for the schools catchup. Are the government waiting for Marcus Rashford to step in before they sort the rest of the funding out?

 

PETER KYLE :

[00:38:00] Kevin Collins was hired by the prime minister and he would have known the direction of travel. When he came back with the report, which was very, very obvious what it was going to report for quite a long time leading up to it, it's very in line with what all the other countries similar to Britain and our committees are calling for.

Suddenly Boris Johnson says no, Richi Sunac cuts the money. Now, for students, what I couldn't understand from all of this, last week I met a parent of a kid who, with his friends, jumped over the fence of his school so that they could get into school and do some activity over the weekend and use the facilities that they have. What does that say about Britain right now? We have students who are breaking into school because they want to be in school so much and the barrier is the government stopping them. We don't have a government which is matching the wishes that young people have for themselves right now. We have a government that has a catch phrase about levelling up. If levelling up is not about students and education. If levelling up is not about investing our people, then what is it for?

Caroline Lucas

[0:10:50] Yes, it has returned, on steroids, I'm afraid. It really has been shocking to see the way in which Owen Paterson has been defended by the Prime Minister that, in a sense, we've abolished any kind of independent system of dealing with MPs' misconduct and instead we have the prospects of a new committee that was going to be a kangaroo court. There was going to be a built-in government majority on the new committee.

So, let’s start with our first question tonight, from our virtual audience, Tessa Marshall? 



Female Aud 1



[00:01:25] Okay.  So, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, will the panel commit to educating the citizens of the UK about the atrocities of the British Empire, take down the statues and the portraits that represent slave traders in the UK, and people who profited from Empire really.  And will you apologise for paying off the owners of slaves that the British people were paying off until as late as 2015? 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:01:58] Robert? 



 



Robert Buckland



[00:01:50] Well, I think we’ve got to confront our history warts and all, and whilst there are many things we can be proud about with regard to Britain and its history, there’s a lot that we need to confront and be honest about, that is bad about our history.  But, I think that applying today’s standards to what may have happened many hundreds of years ago, is a difficult concept, to say the least.  And I think rather than using the language of blame and apology, we should be being honest about it, being forthright about it, using democratic processes wherever possible to deal with it.  So, let’s take for example, particular statues to slave traders, that might be in Bristol or elsewhere, use the democratic process to, through a proper decision, decide what to do with that particular memorial or statue…

Fiona Bruce



[00:02:52] So, do you think the people were wrong to tear it down then? 



 



Robert Buckland



[00:02:55] I think they were.  I think that, whilst I absolutely get and understand the huge strength of feeling that’s been engendered as a result of that appalling incident in Minneapolis, and the fact that many people have just had enough, and I get that utterly, I do think that we all owe it to each other to respect the rule of law, and to within that, work for greater equality.  And I think the scenes that we saw in Bristol were disturbing, in the sense that there didn’t seem to be that sense of order…



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:03:27] You’re Justice Secretary, do you want to see those people prosecuted? 



 



Robert Buckland



[00:03:30] Well I think an investigation is ongoing, and we’ve got to let the police do their job, independently, and let the prosecuting authorities follow the evidence wherever it leads.



But, the point I’m making is that if we stand for something together and collectively in this great country, it’s got to be the rule of law, and those values of freedom that attracted so many people here in the first place, and make this country, whilst it is imperfect, and whilst there is a huge amount for us to do, a good place to live, because we have that underpinning of the rule of law and democracy.  Let’s celebrate that, but let’s be honest and confront the past as well.

Fiona Bruce



[00:04:11] And let me just…Tessa, when you said that you want the government to apologise for reparations paid to countries until 2015, for slavery, what are you referring to? 



 



Female Aud 1



[00:04:20] So yeah, so the debts that we were paying off, refers to the 20 million pounds that was paid off to slave owners, when slavery became illegal in 1837, and so that debt is something that the British Government was paying off until as late as 2015. 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:04:41] Robert?



 



Robert Buckland



[00:04:42] Well, look I think the history of our islands is always with us. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:04:46] But, were we paying off that debt until 2015? 



 



Robert Buckland     



[00:04:47] I think actually, the lady is right, because I’ve read reports similarly about that… 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:04:52] That seems extraordinary. 



 



Robert Buckland     



[00:04:54] But I think she makes a very powerful point about the fact that you cannot escape history, and I think it would be fundamentally dishonest of us to, through removing statues and airbrushing out history, to then pretend that all was well.  Do you know, totalitarian regimes do that?  And communist regimes and other extreme regimes do that sort of thing, and then pretend that all is well, no we need to be honest, face up to it, and accept the fact that we are as much prisoners of our history, as anything else, but we have a chance through democracy, to break free, and progress.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:05:30] Bernadine? 



 



Bernadine Evaristo 



[00:05:32] Yes.  I totally disagree with you actually.  Because I absolutely relish that statue being toppled in Bristol.  They had tried for decades to either get the statue removed, or to get a plaque put on the statue, to provide the context for Colston’s history as a slave trader.  And I think everybody now knows that he was culpable in terms of some 80,000 Africans being enslaves in the New World, and 20,000 of those Africans were also lost at sea. 



So, I think he was a really toxic symbol in Bristol, and it was really important that he should go, or at least be contextualised.  And people tried to do that, and they tried for decades.  They didn’t get anywhere with it.  So, it felt to me that it was totally right that they should topple that statue, because of what he represented, and I am totally for a lot of the other statues in this country, being removed, and perhaps recontextualised in museums, or somewhere where we actually  understand what role they played in society in a wider sense, and the whole idea about… 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:06:44] And which kind of statues for example, Bernadine? 



 



Bernadine Evaristo 



[00:06:46] So, there was somebody removed from outside The Museum of London, for example.  



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:06:49] Yes, Robert Milligan who’s a slave trader.

cutietestrun18June2020,18468,5,"































































































































Bernadine Evaristo 



[00:06:51] There’s also an argument, isn’t there, about Lord Nelson, you know?  Who is such a sort of totemic figure, literally, in this country. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:06:57] And would you want to see his statue come off Nelson’s Column? 



 



Bernadine Evaristo 



[00:06:59] Well, I think we need to have that conversation, probably.  But, there is also this argument that’s come up, in terms of the statues, that we can’t change history and that it is the history of this country.  But actually, history is a construction.  Okay, events happen, we have a past, and then historians contextualise that past and interrogate it.  And what’s happened in this country, is that historically that has been done by elite white men, who have been the historians, who have set the framework for the events of the past.  So, history is something that needs to be challenged, and re-interrogated, and revised constantly. 



And removing those statues, in a sense it’s giving power to the people who really do object to a symbol of their historical slavery and all their allies as well.  The other thing about history, is that history has always excluded primarily women and people of colour, and working class people and LGBTQ+ people, in the ways in which it’s been told.  And that also goes to what you were saying about the colonial history.

Bernadine Evaristo 



You know, a lot of people in this country don’t understand the colonial history, or they understand it through a certain prism, where they feel that Britain went and travelled all over the world, in order to help people.  You know, there is still a section of society who don’t think slavery was a really bad thing.



So, I think it’s really important that we interrogate history and when you have to take the law into your hands and remove a statue, I mean, God, nobody died, you know, it’s just this little tin statue, whatever it was, that was thrown into the river, and it then led to this conversation that we’re having now, about the rest of the relics of Britain’s murky past, then I think it’s really important. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:08:49] And when Tessa talks about removing statues or portraits of anyone who has profited from Empire?  I’m sort of wondering where does that… 



 



Bernadine Evaristo 



[00:08:59] Well…that’s the country, that’s the country isn’t it? 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:09:01] Yes, exactly. 



 



Bernadine Evaristo 



[00:09:02] But I think the visual symbols, the statues are really toxic, and they really are an affront to our shared humanity, and I think at least we need to look at that.  And, do you know, Britain was built on the wealth of slavery and colonialism, that’s the truth.  And we don’t really admit that.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:09:21] Rocco? 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:09:24] Well, there’s a quote of Nelson Mandela that says, ‘Hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment.  We have to understand our history and we have to confront it.’  And I agree very much with what Robert Buckland was saying that we can’t judge the past by the values of today.  And it seems that people are trying to use the evil of slavery to re-write the history of this country, and try and negate the heritage that this country has.  



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:10:04] So, do you think it was wrong to take down the statue of Edward Colston? 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:10:06] Yes, I think it’s wrong to take it down in that way, and I think any vandalism of any kind is completely unacceptable.  It’s against the law, and it’s disgraceful that the police were not there in sufficient numbers to prevent that happening.  



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:10:24] I mean, people have made comparisons… 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:10:25] The worst aspect for me, of the London demonstration was seeing police running away from demonstrators in fear.  That’s a breakdown of law and order, and it’s mob rule.  And it’s completely unacceptable.

[00:10:43] And when you talk about vandalism for example, I mean one example that’s been quoted, and I’m not equating the two, but The Berlin Wall, for example, which obviously people just pulled down themselves, and the police stood by and just let it happen, but that’s…I’m not trying to say the two are the same, but nonetheless it was… 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:11:01] The two things aren’t in anyway comparable. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:11:03] Well, no, but the argument that is made that it was something that people took upon themselves to do… 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:11:05] It’s amazing that we are obsessing about statues of long forgotten people at a time when the country’s sleep-walking to economic disaster, and our children are being prevented from going to school. 



 



Fiona Bruce

Fiona Bruce 



[00:11:23] Okay, well let’s talk to some of our virtual audience that’s got their hands up, [Sim 00:11:28]? 



 



Male Aud 1



[00:11:29] I think it’s important that as a society, we look at the past, but we don’t need to glorify or celebrate the events of the past that we as a nation took part in.  I agree that statues that have links to the past, that bear issues relating to slavery, do need to be taken down.  I’m not asking for them to be hidden, I think they need to be in a museum, because museums are great places to educate and help remember the past.  Maybe even have history about British colonialism or minority ethnic communities in the curriculum, I think that would be an important step that we could take as a society? 



 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:12:17] [Fion 00:12:17]?          



 



Female Aud 2



[00:12:19] I was just going to say, I agree completely with what Bernadine Evaristo said about the fact that in Bristol…  I went to university and Bristol, and for years, you know, it has been a topic of discussion, to take it down and, you know, the voice of the whole democratic thing, they were saying people have been asking to take that down, and people have been ignoring it.  So, in some ways, somebody’s been saying, well not, actually, it needs to stay up there.  So, who were they trying to protect there?  They’re trying to protect the name of, you know, they’re trying to show that their statue should stay, and you say that it’s disturbing the way it was taken down.

If you think about the people that it’s affected, the ancestors of the people that walk past it every day, would it not be disturbing to see someone glorified, when they have killed thousands of people and are being celebrated in a way so publicly, so I just don’t agree exactly with what Rocco or what the Justice Secretary had to say there, that it’s disturbing or in some way that it’s in anyway worse than going the democratic way, when there’s still people trying to justify what that man did.



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:13:16] Elaine?



 



Female Aud 3



[00:13:17]  Hi, I like the idea of Tessa’s second part of the question, because there will be equal measures on both sides.  I’m really interested in how we’ll all come together and have a critical conversation about how we can go forward with this issue.



 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:13:37] Well, let me come to John Williams on that.  John, you wanted to take this question forward? 



 



Male Aud 2



[00:13:45]  Yes.  So, will the possible taking down of 60 statues in the UK, advance the cause of Black Lives Matter?

Fiona Bruce 



[00:13:54] So, Vaughan, I mean this just leads on really from Tessa’s question, whether or not taking the statues down is productive, I don’t know whether you approved of what happened in Bristol, and is it perhaps obscuring a larger, or helping a larger discussion?



 



Vaughan Gething    



[00:14:16] Well, I’m pleased that John’s made his point in his question, because what I was going to say to the original question was, that yes, I do think that some of those statues need to come down, and others that stay up, I think need greater context about who those figures were.  But the Black Lives Matter campaign is not a campaign to re-engineer our public space and remove statues, it’s actually not even about the death of George Floyd, it’s about the persistent and continuing racial inequalities, that affect not just America but other countries around the world, including our own.  And that’s the point.  And I think within that, this is only one small part of a debate that we need to have as a group of countries, but then also an action that we need to take.  And all of us are painfully familiar with the fact that criminal justice [inaudible 00:15:02] different, if you like me compared to Robert.  They’re different in terms of what happens to you in terms of mental health services too.  That’s the sort of action that I think we need to see taken, and get too led down a blind alley here.

Vaughan Gething 



[00:14:16]And in doing that, it’s not just examining our distant past, it’s not even about trying to re-write our history, it’s understanding our history to help deal with our future.  And the way politicians talk about this matters.  So, I think the Prime Minister would be in a better position to do his job, if he recognised that at the start of the 21st century, talking about watermelon smiles and piccaninnies was not helpful, he was an MP at the time.  The same for the leader of Plaid Cymru, [inaudible 00:15:40] in the recent past, too. 



We can all learn from this, and take the opportunity in this extraordinary global movement, to reset, not just our view on our past, but much more importantly to make changes to our shared future. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:15:54] And Liz, obviously you’ll want to respond to what Vaughan has said, but also just looking at John and Tessa’s questions, they’re in sense two sides of the same coin, you know, should we be taking statues down, remove portraits commemorating people who had profited from slavery, or profited from The Empire, Tessa’s saying, or is that in a sense counter-productive, in terms of looking at the bigger issue?



 



Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:16:15] I think certainly this is a time where, I look back to the time when I was raised in Eltham and the terrible appalling murder of Stephen Lawrence, and at that time it drove many establishment changes, but it evidently did not drive enough, we know that.  We know that we live in a racist society.

Liz Saville-Roberts 



[00:16:15] Now there’s one thing that I just could refer back to, what Vaughan said, and this is a little bit disappointing, because frankly Vaughan, I think we are trying to fight from the same corner here, and you do know that Plaid Cymru of course, Adam Price has called for an enquiry into structural racism in Wales, it was in response to his questioning that the first minister of Wales responded with supporting the concept of a black and minority ethnic museum in Wales, and also it’s been Plaid Cymru who’s been leading on perhaps the major point, which is changes to the curriculum.



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:17:12] But what Vaughan’s referring to is obviously, Adam Price apologised for comparing Wales to a kind of colonial outpost?



 



Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:17:19] Yeah, when we’re looking at the real big issues of politics one of the rather petty things that we do in politics in the United Kingdom is bring it down to personalities, and these are big, serious…



 



Vaughan Gething



[00:17:29] There’s nothing petty, it matters.



 



Liz Saville-Robert:  



[00:17:31]…questions.  Now, looking at the statues, and I raised this yesterday with the Prime Minister, of course, what we have within the United Kingdom is the way of presenting history very much through the eyes of the Conservatives.  And the Prime Minister, when I asked him on this question, is that Conservatives don’t pull down statues, Conservatives don’t pull down statues.  It was the imagery of the past.  And I know that the Lord Chancellor will agree with this, we have much legislation in place to deal with racial hatred, but we know that we still live within a racial society, which acts upon racialism and racism.

Liz Saville-Robert 



[00:17:31] So, the question that I have for us now, is how are we going to bring about the big social changes, the big changes in attitudes?  That’s why the statues are so interesting, because they are so symbolic of a certain sort of history that said the Empire was fine, that the British Empire was a force for good, and a force for good only in the world.  This is not true.  And now is the time to come to recognise that it isn’t just the history of powerful white men, who often made their money and their fortunes out of the sufferings of others.  Now is the time for the voice of the others to come through.  And that is my hope for the future, that the fact that we’re having this discussion here, it has to go beyond the usual talking heads of politicians, and get into our curriculum, and really change people’s attitudes.

[00:18:55] Okay.  [Taio? 00:18:56]



 



Male Aud 3



[00:18:56] Slavery has bred racism, as a person in a responsible position I can’t even bring myself to repeat what some politicians, including our Prime Minister, has said in the past about ethnic minorities.  I’ve been reading History at AS level, revising with my son, who didn’t do his proper exam, but I’ve read about [inaudible 00:19:20], the curriculum needs to change.  The War of Independence is depicted as the Indian Mutiny.  That needs to change.  Especially children who are born and bred over here.  My son considers himself as Welsh.  And for him to read history in a different manner than what I have read, and what I’ve read recently, I think it’s important that violence should be condemned, but racism from top down, needs to be dealt with.



I’m very proud to live in Cardiff, and work in Cardiff for the last 25 years, it’s a multicultural society.  But we need to make sure that from top down, from Boris downwards, we need to deal with this racism.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:20:17] And Robert, what, I mean we heard the Prime Minister talk about this at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, the comment he made about piccaninnies waving at the Queen, and watermelon smiles, has come back time and time again to haunt him.  What are we going to see from the government, if anything?



 



Robert Buckland     



[00:20:34] A Prime Minister who was major of probably the most cosmopolitan city in the world, and was elected twice, and whose approach to issues of migration and multiculturalism has been open, liberal and inclusive, and his remarks in the aftermath of the unlawful of George Floyd, I think were appropriate, they struck the right tone, and he talked in a positive way about what needed to be done.  So, I think absolutely, we have the right approach.  I think that sense of trying to bring people together, is what we need now.  And I think a lot of the remarks, I think, are on the money when it comes to the fact that rather than focusing upon icons and statues, actions speak far louder than words, and Vaughan has made the point about the criminal justice system, I have responsibility for that in England and Wales, I absolutely take responsibility for the need to improve the way in which we deal with black and minority ethnic people in that system.  And there’s a whole range of things that we are doing, no time to go into them now, but the sort of practical measures that we’ve got to do, to make the experience different…

Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:21:53] Could I ask one specific question there, please?  The black population in Wales is over-represented by five times within the prison population of Wales, surely that is a desperate failure?  That is an indication of the racism in our society in action.  Would you, as the Secretary of State for Justice, commit to using that as a target to reduce that percentage, that unacceptable percentage within the prison population, specifically in Wales, but of course it applies through England and Wales entirely?



 



Robert Buckland     



[00:22:22] Well, what I commit to Liz, is making sure that the problems that are inherited by the criminal justice system, are dealt with further up the line, and the diversions that are needed in order to help people of that background, not to get into the system in the first place, are what we’re going to have to do.  And that’s not just me, that’s Education, that’s Health, that’s Housing, that’s the whole apparatus of government, in Wales and in Westminster, actually coming together around the problem and the individual, rather than this silo approach that means that I end up being responsible for a system with a disproportionate number of young people from that background within it.

[00:23:01] Bernadine are you…?



 



Vaughan Gething    



[00:23:02] I just think that mealy mouthed refusal to engage in the reality, the Prime Minister has said something deeply offensive at the start of the 21st century, it is a real issue.  For people that look like me, having a Prime Minister who used the language of watermelon smiles and piccaninnies, it matters, just as someone comparing the experience of Wales to colonialism and the African American experience, it matters and it’s offensive.  And if we want to move on, we’ve got to accept that isn’t acceptable, and you gain credit for yourselves and your parties, and actually the healing that I want to see taking place right across the United Kingdom [inaudible 00:23:38] knowledge that is staring you in the face.  ‘Cause it isn’t just the fact that I’m a politician, I’m this colour every day of the week, every single day of the year, and it matters to me that we are spoken about and treated in a way that reflects who we are, and not the colour of our skin.  So use language that matters and make sure you’re not making these mealy mouthed apologies for things that are plainly wrong.

Bernadine Evaristo 



[00:24:02] I think that, you know, I’ve found Boris offensive all along, with his journalism in The Spectator, with the racist things that he said.  When he became Mayor of London, yes, he became mayor of an incredibly multicultural city, but one of the first things that he tried to do, was to get rid of Black History Month, right?  So, we’re talking here about the importance of history and acknowledging the past, and also we should be celebrating the entire population, people of colour and our contribution to this society, we’ve been here since the Romans, it’s something I’ve written about, and we have a mayor who tries to get rid of the single thing that we do, to bring to the wider public, the fact that we have a history.  And in fact, the truth is, of course, black history is British history.  This is a multicultural country and always has been.  And British history is world history, because we had an Empire, that ruled over a quarter of the world, for a very long time.  So, I really don’t accept you apologising or trying to present Boris Johnson in a good light, because I’ve found him deeply offensive.

Female Aud 3



[00:26:05] Hello.  Good evening.  Like myself and many other independent restaurants, our restaurant is very much family based, and five of our family members are dependant on that business.  Since Covid-19 has come around, social distancing seems to inevitable in hospitality.  Once lockdown is lifted, we imagine 25 to 50 per cent of our capacity will only be achieved, and we feel that only fixed costs may be covered, or may not be covered.  In the short term and the longterm, what strategies will the government and stakeholder organisations put forward for our industry, taking into account there’s so much debt already been created by independent family business now? 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:26:59] And Rosina, you mentioned social distancing, of course two metres in this country is the acceptable social distancing.  Rocco, I’m going to come to you obviously, first, with your hotel business.



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:27:08] Well, yes, this two metre social distancing rule has sort of come out of the blue, there’s no scientific evidence behind it.  The WTO has just come out and said, if you’re two metres away you have a one per cent chance of catching the disease, and if you’re one metre away you have a three per cent chance of catching the disease.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:27:33] This is the WHO, the World Health Organisation? 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:27:36] Yes, WHO.  The reality in continental Europe, which has started to open up, is that they’ve gone back to one metre.



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:27:47] Some of them, not all of them have, but yes, some of them have.  So you’ve got, what have we got?  We’ve got China? 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:27:50] A lot of them have.  So, Italy has and Germany has and…



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:27:54] Germany is at one and a half metres, as is Italy.  France and Denmark are at one metre at the moment.



 



Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:28:01] And Spain is higher



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:28:02] And the reality of this whole thing, is no one is concentrating on the economic impacts of this, and the reality of this disease, which at first was thought to be a terrible disease, and was going to kill millions of people, it’s not turned out to be like that.  A lot of the surveys that have been done show it’s 0.1 to 0.2 per cent of people, who die if they catch the disease and the reality is…

Fiona Bruce 



[00:28:34] The other suggestion is one per cent, and in some countries higher.



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:28:40] Well, I don’t know, no, I mean the only thorough research that’s been done, was one done by Stanford on the New York epidemic, which is one of the hot beds in the United States, and it’s come out with these figures.  So, the reality of this disease is that it hits, the average age of people who’ve died in this country is 80.  A third of them have died in the care homes, it’s a disgrace what’s happened in the care homes, but it’s…



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:29:11] But when it comes to the hospital industry, for example, and obviously Rosina’s talking about her restaurant here, if the government sticks with this two metre social distancing, is it going to be viable for you, for example, to open, you’ve got hotels around the world?



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:29:27] No, it isn’t.  It isn’t. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:29:28] You’ve got hotels around the world, but do you have them in this country?



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:29:30] There are a number of aspects to hotels opening and so on, a lot of hotels in this country depend on international travel.  If there’s no international travel, they won’t have customers, they won’t be able to open.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:29:41] So you’re opposing the quarantine as well?



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:29:43] Yes, of course.  Yeah, I mean the quarantine, again, it’s got no scientific evidence behind it.  The chief scientific officer says it’s a political decision, not a scientific decision.  We’re closing down, and the rest of Europe is opening up.  Until Sunday you could come from Iran or Brazil, the two highest hotbeds of the disease, with impunity, and all of a sudden on Sunday evening, no one could come in.



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:30:10] So, can I just ask you, so with your hotels in other countries where the distancing is a metre or one and a half metres, can you open economically, profitably, with that kind of social distancing?



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:30:21] It’s still difficult, but a metre makes it possible.  I mean, the tourism industry has suffered disproportionately, effectively it’s been without income since March, and will continue to be without income in this country until July, so that’s four months, a third of the year, and many, many businesses in the tourism industry will go under.  You impose quarantine which stops foreigners coming into this country, just when there was a chance to save something out of the summer season, it’s another nail in the coffin, a two metre rule makes it impossible for the people to open properly.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:31:04] Vaughan, when it comes to Wales, the First Minister has said he doesn’t expect most of Welsh tourism to be running this summer at all, at best hope self-catering, so what do you think in response to what Rosina said and what Rocco Forte has had to say?



 



Vaughan Gething    



[00:31:19] Well, it’s difficult, but I’m very proud of the fact that our government in Wales, has as our priority how to keep Wales safe.  We’ve taken a deliberately cautious approach to easing out of lockdown, because I simply disagree with Rocco’s characterisation of Covid-19 and its impact.  It is a dreadful disease, it’s taken thousands of extra lives, tens of thousands across the UK, and would have taken many more if we hadn’t imposed lockdown when we did.  And I don’t think you can try to balance off health against economy.  If we come out of lockdown too quickly, we’ll not only see lives lost, we will see a much greater impact upon our economy.  So, we are looking at a range of measures that we take, which [inaudible 00:32:03] have more economic activity take place, but to do so unashamedly on the basis that we’ve got to do this in the safest way possible, and that does mean necessary caution.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:32:13] So, how can you help Rosina? 



 



Vaughan Gething    



[00:32:16] We have a two metre rule in our regulations, we have to consider that, and we’re not about to change the law on that, because I think there’s good evidence actually, that you are safer, you have double the risk having a one metre rule, as opposed to a two metre rule.  The Scientific Group on Emergencies, has advised all the governments of the UK on that. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:32:33] Okay.



 



Vaughan Gething    



[00:32:34] And I’m not about to risk the lives of our citizens, on the basis of what Rocco suggests.



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:32:40] So, the conclusion of that is Rosina’s business might go to the wall.  Rosina, you’ve got your hand up, let’s hear from you again.



 



Female Aud 3



[00:32:48] I’m not saying about reducing the social distancing of two metres, if that’s the law, that’s law.  And I think even if you reduced it to one metre, I don’t think that would make a lot of difference, because I think in the mind of the consumer, it’s very much scorched in about the two metre rule, about staying away from other people.  I think even if you reduced it to half a metre, I think people are going to stay away.  So our dilemma is not just in the next week, or the next two weeks or the next month, I think is a much, much longer longterm problem that the hospitality are going to have.

[00:33:26] Hi, sorry, in Wales, more than 95 per cent of our businesses are small and micro businesses, and at the moment, there is zero admissions going into Gwent, and there are really low admissions going into Heath Hospital.  So, there’s no evidence really, to suggest keeping a lockdown in place, but also have they already taken into account what impact this is going to have on all these small businesses, and our economy in Wales, which could be severely affected if we keep some of these guidelines in place?

[00:33:59] I just wanted to ask, once furlough has ended, should we prepare for mass redundancies for businesses that can no longer function in the new normal?



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:34:07]  And let me hear from John? 



 



Male Aud 5



[00:34:09] The economy in Wales has always been a House of Cards, we’re very dependant on the public sector.  And we should have been leading the way in reopening, but we’re not, we’re forever days, weeks behind, what Westminster’s doing, and really the Welsh Assembly sits on its hands for three weeks, in between thawing out a few little tit bits of very, very minor trivial relaxing.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:34:40] Robert, looking at the situation in England, we had the Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, warning that three and a half million jobs are at risk in the hospitality sector.  The government’s coming under a lot of pressure from Conservative MPs to do more for businesses like Rosina’s, and in particular reduce this two metre distance, any chance of that happening?



 



Robert Buckland     



[00:35:00] Well look, I think Rosina actually makes a really important about the confidence that people will have, and, you know, governments will have regulations and have plans and guidance, but without that confidence, then, you know, other things will happen.  And I think she’s right to remind us that this isn’t going to be something that we will have an end date to, and that all will be well.  We have, of course, extended things like the furlough scheme into October, and in Wales, about 418 thousand people have been supported through various government schemes, which is welcome, but this isn’t a problem for weeks or months, this is a problem that’s going to endure for a much longer period. 



I think within government, we’re right to have the debate, in fact the debate is happening across the country, because as you said, there are different international standards.  But, I do think it’s right that we stick to the [lath 00:35:49] on two metres, we’ve got to be clear about that.

Robert Buckland 



[00:35:00] Clarity is something that people demand from government.  And whilst it’s right of us to consider the evidence and to constantly evaluate and question and make adjustments, the two metre rule certainly stays for the foreseeable.  I think with regard to the other measures… 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:36:11] It’s confusing though isn’t it, given that some countries are going for a metre, the WHO is suggesting a metre, and then you’ve got other countries that are going for one and a half metre, people are wondering, where’s the…it’s all one science, so how is that decision made? 



 



Robert Buckland     



[00:36:24] I think, Fiona, it’s a question of two stages; the evidence and the advice you get from SAGE and the scientists forms part of a decision making, that is ultimately political, the two stage approach to it.  And there will be a number of different factors in that.  I think the challenge for government now, as we come out of this period of really intense lockdown, is how to get the combination right.  And that’s why there’s been a big debate about the quarantine.  Clearly at the time of the height of the outbreak, quarantine would have made no difference, but now, the advice that we get, is that even small adjustments can affect that R rate, and therefore it’s a constant evaluation to see what adjustments we can make, to help people in Rosina’s position, and to get the balance right between the need to open up, but the need to save lives as well.

[00:37:14] Bernadine?



 



Bernadine Evaristo 



[00:37:15] Yeah, I don’t know, I don’t know what the solution is.  So, if the hospitality industry does open up, as you would like Rocco, how do you keep people safe, you know?  You can’t open up with social distancing, so how do you keep people safe?



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:37:31] But I think it’s up to the consumer to decide what he wants to do.  I mean people have been terrified by the government propaganda, and in a way that’s gradually breaking down already, you see it with the people on the beaches, you see it with people in the parks.  They’re not social distancing and two metres, the only place I’ve seen it happening is here, tonight. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:37:54] And we’re doing it very well.  But, it’s not just propaganda, Rocco.



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:37:57] [voices overlap 00:37:57] talking about the economy, it’s not about the economy, it’s about the livelihoods of millions of people.  We’re not talking about thousands here, we’re talking about millions of people who are going to lose their jobs, and their families, and it’ll affect their health and everything else.  You can’t just sweep it aside, oh it’s just the economy.  What about the resorts in Wales, like Rhyl, Llandudno, Porthcawl, which depend entirely on a summer season?  Those people are not going to be able to function.  They’re not going to survive.  They’ve had one winter, they’re going into another winter, and the summer which should have lifted them up, is not going to be there if you carry on like this.  So all those businesses are going to be devastated [voices overlap 00:38:46] and all the jobs that go with them.

Rocco Forte 



[00:39:07] The German, there’s a report by experts in the German government, which was leaked, which says that the German government’s reaction was completely over the top, was unnecessary, they compared it to the 2017 and ’18 influence epidemic, which killed one and a half million people across the world, it killed 25,000 people in Germany, 28,000 in this country, and the economy of the world was not locked down.  In ’68, when I was 23, we had the Hong Kong Flu.  That killed over a million people worldwide.  We had 80,000 in this country.  I don’t remember anything about it, it wasn’t talked about.

[00:39:54] And yet we are still at 63,00 excess deaths for this time, and we are the highest country in Europe for deaths?  Now one of the things that the public knows, and people should make their own responses, and this is one of the reasons, I think, why people are still keeping to the two metres themselves, Professor Neil Ferguson has said it, we went into lockdown too late, and we went into lockdown too late because Boris Johnson likes to think that he will let people do what they want to do.

Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:40:24] Now, here in Wales, I deeply fear when the furlough scheme is starting to scale down, it starts to scale down in August, when businesses are responsible for taking on their national insurance and their pensions.  Seventy four per cent of our business are dependant, are using the furlough scheme.  And of course, I represent an area, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, which is deeply dependant on the tourism industry, and I fear what is going to happen with that industry, and I talk to people like the Ffestiniog Railway, an absolute jewel in the crown, the heritage railways in North Wales, absolute jewel in the crown, they are facing what they call, the three winter scenario.

[00:40:24] And when the furlough scheme ceases, regardless of what Welsh Government says, because Welsh Government hasn’t got the means of funding their own policies, they are going to be facing the situation, and many, many other businesses, where they’ll be making redundancies this summer.  This is the three winter scenario.



Now, to come back to the question of public confidence, because at the heel of the hunt, it will be public confidence that changes this, we need an effective test and trace system in place, that is seen by people to work, both in Wales and in England, and until people have that confidence, then we’re going to see the same problem coming up.  Alongside this, I beg both our governments, the Welsh government and the UK government, the English government in this respect, look at what’s happening to our tourism and hospitality industry, look at our dependants on this.  These people will go out of business and there will be immense suffering in the terms of unemployment.  Please do not pull the wool over our eyes.  We need these industries into the future, and I fear what will happen this summer.

[00:42:10]  Hi, okay, so we’ve recruited 25,000 contact tracers, however with today’s test and trace results showing that a third of people who are testing positive are not providing any details for those close contacts, is the system good enough, and is it up to scratch?



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:42:30] Robert, also I’m going to come to you on that, ‘cause we’ve had the figures out today, from the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.  Vaughan, let me just start with you.  I mean contact traces have been happening in Wales for some period of time, but what we don’t know, I think, is how many people are actually being contacted, and agreeing to handover their contacts, is that right?



 



Vaughan Gething

Vaughan Gething 



[00:42:50] And so it does show we’ve got an effective system here, we’ve delivered that in partnership between our National Health Service and the [authorities that deliver the system 00:43:33].  So, I think the question really describes the position in England, in Wales our start has been much more effective than that, and the challenge is how we continue to do that, as we progressively unlock more activity when it’s safe to do so.  



So, here in Wales, I think we have a good story to tell about our start to contact tracing, and I’m very proud of the work that our public services are doing to deliver that service to help keep Wales safe. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:43:58] Do you agree with that Liz?



 



Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:44:00] Well, we know the fiasco that happened with the testing targets from Wales, where they had to be given up on.  We actually had to give up on targets because they were so impossible to reach.  And I would go back to the question of the Roche testing contract, when we know that thousands of tests were taken away from Wales, by the UK government, and for some reason or other, I think the people of Wales deserve to hear the full story of this, and yet I understand Vaughan, that you’re not releasing the actual email correspondence, which was the reason as to why we don’t have these tests in Wales.

[00:44:00] Over and above that, representing a highly rural area, which of course is served by Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board, and Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board has been in special measures for five years, what I get people concerned about with me, is that they just can’t get the results from their tests back again.  So, I’m sad to say that we have these high stories, but when it comes down to people’s experience on the ground, and that critical way that we need to be getting people’s confidence back, they need to see the tests working, that’s the only way that’s going to unlock people’s confidence and then unlock our economy.



 



Vaughan Gething    



[00:45:06] Well, there’s some facts to deal with there, if I may?  When it comes to test results in Wales, over 90 per cent of the people get their test results within 48 hours.  The idea that it’s somehow a widespread problem with late test results, simply doesn’t match the facts.  When it comes to our testing capacity, the review that I ordered into where we were, revealed that we couldn’t meet those early aspirations about the number of tests we wanted, because equipment was delayed in other countries, some countries stopped the export of testing equipment.

Vaughan Gething 



[00:45:06] We’re now in a much better place, we have well over 12,000 tests available daily if we need them in Wales.  To give you an idea, if that were equivalent for the whole of the UK, we’d have a UK capacity of well over 260,000 tests, so actually we have more than, if you like, the share of the whole UK capacity would be because of the programme we have successfully implemented.  When it comes to turning around test results, we’re actually in a decent place, but I want to see us get better, it will help us to maintain public confidence in test, trace and protect, if we can turn around those tests even faster.  So, I’m committed to understanding what we can do to make it better, openly publishing the data we have, and to give that confidence to people.  So, the facts, I think, don’t bear out the comments that Liz has actually made.

Fiona Bruce 



[00:46:19] Briefly, Liz, ‘cause I need to get around the panel.



 



Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:46:20] Contact testing was started in Wales, and stopped almost immediately.  The only place where it carried on was Ceredigion, where they’ve had the lowest deaths and the lowest rate, I think 61 amongst 100,000 of infection.

Vaughan Gething    



[00:46:33] There’s also been the [inaudible 00:46:34] incidence in that county as well though Liz, so it isn’t a matter of the contact tracing system determining.  And as with every part of the UK, they stopped contact tracing in the early part of the pandemic, because we simply didn’t have the resources to carry on doing that.  Now, that is the truth of the matter.  I do wish we’d had greater capacity at an earlier point in time, to allow us to make a different choice.  But, we made choice with the facts available to us.  We’re making choices now, that are all about we keep Wales safe, and we’re actually doing a decent job compared to other parts of [the UK 00:47:03]. 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:47:04] Okay, let me drag us back to Shakeel’s question, which is talking about the 25,000 contact tracers in England, with today’s test and trace results showing that a third of the people who tested positive, are not handing over their contacts to then be traced and isolate.  Is that good enough? 



 



Robert Buckland     



[00:47:26] Well, I think we can do even more.  I mean, let’s remember that that meant that two thirds did the right thing, and of that two thirds, 85 per cent then confirmed that they would self-isolate, that’s nearly 27,000 people who will now have the benefit of this system, so…

[00:47:52] And why do you think that is?



 



Robert Buckland     



[00:47:53] Well, I’m concerned about that.  I think it’s all of our collective duty to work with the authorities, to do everything we can to do our part, and clearly we’ve got to get the message over again and again, about the importance of sharing that information, and we share it in a voluntary way, but we do it in a spirit of collective coming together to fight this virus.  I think this is only the first week, but I think the figures are encouraging.



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:48:20] I know, I just mention it simply because, some minutes that came out from SAGE, which of course is the scientific body advising the government, say that 80 per cent of contacts need to be traced, in order for this system to be effective.  And if a third of the people aren’t handing over their contacts at all, you’re not going to get anywhere near that are you?

I’ve never underestimated the sense of the Welsh public or the British public, to do the right thing.

I think there is a privacy issue, and I do think there’s a trust issue, actually I kind of agree with Ross, because I certainly haven’t taken my lead from this government, in terms of the pandemic.  I went into lockdown some 10 days before the government told me to, because it was glaringly obvious to me that I should do, and I might have saved my life, I don’t know.  Because I zap around London on the tube all the time.  And the week before I went into lockdown, the tube was heaving, people were coughing and spluttering and sniffing, it was terrible.  And I do know people who continued to travel around London, who got the virus, you know?  So I did not take my leadership from this government.  And we know about Boris and him shaking hands with coronavirus patients in a hospital, when we all knew that you shouldn’t be making physical contact with people.

[00:52:23] Testing is one thing, tracking is another one, but it’s the speed of results of the test which is important.  I was desperate to get back to work when I was tested, but it took three days for my results to come back.  I was desperate, because I knew I was needed in work.  But, when you hear stories like, getting your eyes tested, by driving a certain amount of miles, and the lack of leadership.  [We’re fortunate to have Vaughan Gething here 00:52:55].  Yes, the majority of people might get their results, but for healthcare workers, I think it’s important that the speed of reporting should be quicker.  Not only that, the results and the statistics that we look for, we need to have those results quicker, we need to learn from Korea, where the results come within a day, and then the track and testing process is much faster with isolation.  So, we needed to learn much quicker from Korea, and other countries who have dealt with it, rather than wait for lack of leadership, and not condemning what the Prime Minister’s aid did or the other ingredients within the whole recipe of protecting people. 



I feel much safer with this two metre rule over here, but then the lack of PPE, hearing stories and the report coming out about ethnic minority doctors, why they’re dying more than the others, these are the issues that we need to have clear recommendations, to make sure that we are moving in the right direction.  We need to protect every life that we can.

[00:54:09] Of course, not just doctors, we’re talking about all healthcare staff.  Rocco?



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:54:12] Well, it’s very peculiar this virus, and it doesn’t affect everybody in the same way.  The week before I emerged with the symptoms, which was actually coincided with lockdown, I worked cheek by jowl with six senior executives in my office, because we were planning for the issues that we had to face, and none of them got the disease.  In my household, which has 11 people and two children, and we were all together in it, only four people got the disease.  And why didn’t the others catch it?  And so, I think a lot of the modelling that’s taking place, is based on assumptions that are completely wrong.  



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:55:07] It is a new disease, of course? 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:55:09] Yeah, I know, well yes, but I mean, 500,000 deaths were based on a computer model, completely false assumptions.  Probably… 



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:55:21] Well I’m not sure that Neil Ferguson shares that view, but yes. 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:55:22] …the 25,000 less deaths that we would have had if we’d locked down earlier, the same wrong assumptions have been put into the computer model, why should we believe them?

Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:55:30] But Rocco, forgive me, this illness is not known to science for more than perhaps six months.  We cannot say for certain how it will pan out.  



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:55:40] No, but I mean… 



 



Liz Saville-Roberts  



[00:55:41] They’re making the best assessments under the circumstances. 



 



Rocco Forte 



[00:55:42]…a lot of the…this whole two metre distance is based principally on the Spanish Flu, the second wave is based on the Spanish Flu, a completely different disease to this.  The last two coronaviruses petered out on their own, and this will probably happen with this one.



 



Fiona Bruce 



[00:59:59] Well, that would be marvellous if that were the case, I’m not sure that there is certainty on that, far from it, I think Rocco, but thank you.  We are out of time, which is why I’m closing you down on that I’m afraid.

[0:00:00] Our first question tonight is from Dale Jackson.

AudienceMember 20210722QT22

[0:00:04] Hi there Fiona. Thank you. Yes my question is do you think it's double standards and hypocrisy allowing footballers, VIPs, in the UK without quarantining whilst lockdown is still in place? Which I kind of think is wrong.

Fiona Bruce

[0:00:22] So you obviously, you do think it's hypocritical, so this is about 2500 EUFA dignitaries and sponsors are going to be allowed to come to the Euros final without having to quarantine wherever they come from? Yes. You think it is hypocritical?

AudienceMember 20210722QT23

[0:00:36] Well it is. Because, the Government are asking us to stick by the rules, quarantine and do our Social Distancing and everything else and doing our tests. Yet they are still allowing people coming in from the UK into the UK, sorry, that are not having to quarantine. And that's wrong! On so many levels.

[0:00:04] Hi there Fiona. Thank you. Yes my question is do you think it's double standards and hypocrisy allowing footballers, VIPs, in the UK without quarantining whilst lockdown is still in place? Which I kind of think is wrong.

[0:00:22] So you obviously, you do think it's hypocritical, so this is about 2500 EUFA dignitaries and sponsors are going to be allowed to come to the Euros final without having to quarantine wherever they come from? Yes. You think it is hypocritical?

[0:00:36] Well it is. Because, the Government are asking us to stick by the rules, quarantine and do our Social Distancing and everything else and doing our tests. Yet they are still allowing people coming in from the UK into the UK, sorry, that are not having to quarantine. And that's wrong! On so many levels.

[0:00:04] Hi there Fiona. Thank you. Yes my question is do you think it's double standards and hypocrisy allowing footballers, VIPs, in the UK without quarantining whilst lockdown is still in place? Which I kind of think is wrong.

[0:00:22] So you obviously, you do think it's hypocritical, so this is about 2500 EUFA dignitaries and sponsors are going to be allowed to come to the Euros final without having to quarantine wherever they come from? Yes. You think it is hypocritical?

[00:01:40] Thank you, Fiona. Do you think that this pandemic has been managed better by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland than it has by Boris Johnson in England?

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:52] Kate.

Kate Forbes

[00:01:54] Well, I don’t think it is a competition because every government is responsible with the trust of the people to manage this pandemic in a way that sees the virus suppressed and also trying to manage the other harms, whether those are economic, social or other health harms. We’ve seen from some of the polling, certainly even this week, that, I think, about three-quarters of people in Scotland are satisfied with the way that Nicola Sturgeon has handled the pandemic.

Fiona Bruce

[00:02:18] She is handling it better-than-Boris Johnson?

Kate Forbes

[00:02:24] I think it is one of the most challenging situations for any leader to be in. At the very beginning she said we’re going to make mistakes. She has been upfront right throughout with integrity and honesty that things have been challenging.

[0:00:44] I'm quite against it, to be honest. It should be a different strategy. I think people should be encouraged to have vaccinations. Like many people from the BMA community I have a vaccine hesitancy in order to overcome to have the vaccine, to be fair, to be convinced about it, I had to think about it quite a lot. That's as someone who is in the NHS. I think if you look at, you know, over 20% of NHS workers come from BAME communities. If you try to mandate these things you will have people who are vaccine-hesitant become vaccine -- so I think you make the problem worse.

[00:01:26] Thank you, Fiona. In light of UK-wide COVID cases remaining significantly high and deaths consistently averaging over 100 per day, should the governments reimpose more restrictions to prevent a winter wave?

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:43] Andrew, more restrictions, should the government impose them, given how infections are rising?

Andrew Bowie

[00:01:49] Well, thanks for the question. Obviously the rise of infections is something that is concerning the government. They continue to watch the data and continue to look at the trajectory on which we're headed.

And let’s hear our first question tonight, which is from Charlie Shrimpton.



 



Charlie Shrimpton



[00:01:28] What does it tell us about the government’s priorities that they were forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford so that the poorest people in the country, and especially children, would be fed over the summer holidays?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:01:41] So, obviously, talking about the free school meal vouchers for children. James?



 



James Cleverly



[00:01:47] Well, coronavirus has meant that we have had to bring about an unprecedented range of support packages for individuals, for businesses, for the self-employed and indeed for families, and we...



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:02:00] Yes, but you weren’t going to do this until Marcus Rashford said.



 



James Cleverly



[00:02:03] And we had…we’d already supported families to help feed their children during the Easter break. And ultimately, we’re trying to get back to a more normal way of working. And we had hoped that we would not need to put this additional support package in place over the summer, but we do listen, the government did listen; and Marcus put forward a really compelling argument and we did listen and the government decided to extend the existing scheme into the summer holidays. I think it was the right thing to do. And ultimately, what we’re trying to do, as I say, is we’re trying to get back towards normality, because really that’s what everyone wants and that’s what we’re working towards.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:02:53] Jed?

cutietestrun2September2020,18841,2,"









































Jed Mercurio



[00:02:54] Well, firstly, I think we all want to pay tribute to Marcus Rashford for the campaign. You know, what a great example this young man is as well as being a fantastic footballer, and I say that as a Manchester United fan, so maybe I’m biased. But what I would also say is that I sometimes despair of hearing things called U‑turns. I think it stops people in positions of authority from listening and changing their minds and responding to the democratic force that got behind Marcus’ campaign. And sometimes I worry that if we use that type of language it sometimes makes it more difficult for governments to do the right thing. And I would definitely say that it’s something that we should all welcome, the fact that the government listened and acted in the way that it has.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:03:51] And Charlie, you’re a teacher, what was your response?



 



Charlie Shrimpton



[00:03:54] But, Jed, if you use language such as a U-turn…or if you do the right thing in the first place, you will not need to use that language at all. My experience is that I see every day how these vouchers make an impact. And the difference of a child having a meal and coming to school is far greater than not having a meal at all and it gives them the opportunity to be able to flourish, and for that there is no price.

Fiona Bruce



[00:04:17] Steve?



 



Steve Parish



[00:04:18] Well, firstly, I would agree with Jed. I mean, I think that Marcus Rashford is an example, as have lots of footballers been through this crisis, of people that know the right thing to do, do the right thing to do and act in the right way. I’d also agree with Jed that I think the language of U-turns and all of these kind of brick bats that we throw at politicians often means that we just don’t get to the right answer, and what’s important is we get to the right answer. So, I’m pleased that we did, I think it’s the right thing. I’m pleased that Marcus showed our profession in the light that I see it every day, and long may it continue. And long may the government, any government that we have, continue to listen to the right arguments and make the right decisions.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:04:59] And one of the things that was so compelling about Marcus Rashford was because he was talking about his own experience of poverty as a child and going to friends’ houses when food was short in his own home. Are there other footballers that you know that have lived that kind of life experience?



",Mascha Graupe,14:06,16.5,14,14,1,9,14,7,1,1,1232.0,63469402:41
cutietestrun2September2020,25544,4,"













































































Steve Parish



[00:05:13] The vast majority of footballers, you know, come from backgrounds that wouldn’t be considered affluent. And what a lot of people don’t realise is, what an extended network of people they look after and are responsible for, particularly many of the players that come from overseas. So, you know, the picture that’s portrayed of footballers as being, sort of, young men with too much money just really isn’t fair in most of the cases that I come into contact with. And certainly, I’ve been incredibly proud of all of the players that I know and the way they’ve acted through the whole crisis.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:05:49] So, Lisa, the question from Charlie is, what does it tell us about the government’s priorities that it was forced into this decision by Marcus Rashford.



 



Lisa Nandy



[00:05:58] Well, I mean, I agree with Jed. I think, I very much welcome the fact that the government did a U-turn on this. And I think the campaign that Marcus Rashford led was really inspirational, but it shouldn’t take a brave young footballer to shame the government into action. The real question is, how could we possibly only 48 hours ago still have been debating whether we were going to allow some children to go starving hungry over the school holidays? 



",Hyewon Jang,7:26,11.5,11,10,2,4,9,2,1,1,1372.0,63469396:47
cutietestrun2September2020,18843,5,"































































































And even on the day that we had that vote in the houses of parliament, that Labour had called and the day that the government decided to U-turn, the Prime Minister was at the dispatch box denying the existence of 600,000 children who’ve been pushed into poverty since 2012 and the fact that that is projected to rise.



 



Now, this is a result of an approach to government that has systematically stripped support away from children over the last decade, so that now schools in my constituency have to employ workers using the pupil premium to go round to children’s houses, stock their cupboards, put money in the gas or electricity meter, and deal with rats and mice because the parents just simply don’t have enough money to make ends meet. So, when James says, let’s get back to normal, I say, let’s get back to a new normal and build a better country based on better values when we come out the other side of this, because children have been last up to now and they’ve been invisible. Let’s make sure that when we rebuild this country, let’s change that and let’s make sure that they come first.

[00:07:26] Belinda, I was just watching you there, nodding your head along to what Lisa was saying.



 



Belinda



[00:07:33]



Yes, you know, looking at the root of the question that Charlie asked, in terms of what does it say about the government and, like you say, you know, it took such a high profile footballer for that to happen. If we’re responding to coronavirus, and I admit there’s millions that have been ploughed into this, in order to get to that new normal, how can we trust that the government is going to make those decisions without having the intervention?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:08:10] Munira?



 



Munira Wilson



[00:08:12] Well, in 2020 in the United Kingdom no child should be going hungry, and the fact that it’s taken a footballer to help the government to realise that and actually change its policy I think is shameful, frankly. It’s not a new issue, holiday hunger; we know that several billion children suffer from holiday hunger normally, and that’s obviously exacerbated by the crisis that we face.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:08:39] And were the Lib Dems pushing to extend the free school meal vouchers?

James Cleverly



[00:09:39] Well, it is worth remembering that this is a scheme that we had already put in place, we’re talking about extending an existing scheme. And it’s also worth remembering that the unprecedented circumstances that we find ourselves in has meant that the government have put forward a range of support packages at a scale that we have never seen before in British politics. So, we are absolutely determined to make sure that families can put food on their table and that’s why we’re supported people who are furloughed at the moment. We are working so hard to get through these unbelievably difficult sets of circumstances and, ultimately, we’re trying to balance the competing financial and social pressures. And sometimes when someone shines a light on a particular issue and we look again at it and we make the decision that this is something that we can extend and should extend through the summer... And I’m very very grateful that Marcus did that, I’m very grateful we listened, I’m very grateful that we responded.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:10:52] Okay, let’s take another question from Deborah Norrish.

Deborah Norrish



[00:10:57] Good evening, everyone. Is a delay in learning of six months genuinely devastating to a whole generation, as was suggested by Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of…and the Chief Inspector of Schools?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:11:14] Jed – devastating for a whole generation?



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:11:17] I think the problem with sending kids back to the school, and the delay, is something that we should all be concerned about. I think that the fact is that the time that children spend in school at a vulnerable age is precious time and I think it will be very very hard for them to catch up. So I think that definitely more should’ve been done in terms of planning. I think that there has been a failure of planning to get children back into school. I think that, obviously, the pandemic arrangements have put an enormous strain on the infrastructures in our society. But I also think that if you look at what is required for children to go back to school, it’s not just the fact that children need to go back to school, it’s that society needs those children back into school, because of all the things that surround children being in school – not requiring child care, and so forth. And I really wish that the government had gone about the planning in a more forthright and more detailed way.

Fiona Bruce



[00:12:32] And Deborah, I’m wondering…you were asking the question and I know you’re a deputy headteacher, the way you phrase it makes me wonder if you think actually it isn’t genuinely devastating…or isn’t devastating for a generation of children?



 



Deborah Norrish



[00:12:43] It’s been absolutely awful. This week we…so, I work in a secondary school in Plymouth and we’ve had our year tens and 12s back for the first time. And first of all, it’s absolutely delightful to see them all, but it’s absolutely horrifying that we can’t provide more, and they’re desperate for it. Attendance this week has been brilliant and, you know, clearly home learning isn’t doing the job for them that we need it to do. We haven’t got clarity yet on, you know, what’s going to happen with their exams next year and the assessment. And as school leaders we are desperate for further guidance about planning for September, and our students are becoming disillusioned at not having it, I think.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:13:19] Marsha, you have your hand up.

Marsha



[00:13:22] I’m a parent to year ten and year 12 children and I was wondering whether any consideration is being given to the requests for reducing the curriculum content for the GCSEs and A levels next summer?



 



Fiona Bruce

Marsha



[00:13:42] Exactly.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:13:43] Munira?



 



Munira Wilson



[00:13:45] Well, I think everybody, whether you’re a parent, you’re a teacher, a school governor, everybody is desperate to get children back to school. We know the detrimental impact it’s having on their wellbeing as well as on their educational development, but clearly we’ve got to do that when it’s safe.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:14:03] And the Lib Dems have put a whole range of suggestions in place that have to happen before children go back to school.



 



Munira Wilson



[00:14:07] That’s right.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:14:09] So you’re not in any great rush to get them back.

Munira Wilson



[00:14:10] No, we’ve put forward a plan, which includes things like identifying safe spaces that could then…having a safe space register that would open up safe community spaces that could potentially be used as additional space for schooling, so that you can then get the kids back to school safely. I mean, my concern is, first of all, the test and trace system clearly isn’t up and running properly. And for any part of lockdown, whether that’s schools or other…or parts of the economy to be opened up, we need to be testing, tracing and isolating every single case to keep people safe.



 



The other thing is just the lack of plan, as Jed was saying. I would’ve hoped that there would’ve been a plan put forward with a range of scenarios perhaps. And certainly, I was talking to head teachers in my constituency on Wednesday and they said to me, we urgently need a plan so that we can start to prepare for September so that we know what we’re doing, but we need that now.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:15:16] Well, let’s see if we can find out what the plan is, we’ve got James here.

Munira Wilson



[00:15:18] But one thing I just would like to add is that a lot of parents feel like they haven’t had a voice in this debate and there’s been this big blame game going on between government and the unions. And the reason why we ended up with a slight change of guidance for primary schools was because there was a lack of engagement and lack of communication between government and schools and unions to understand what was workable.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:15:38] Okay, so what is the plan, James?



 



James Cleverly



[00:15:40] Well, I’ve got two boys at school; my eldest has just finished and unfortunately wasn’t able to sit his A levels. So I know the huge and understandable desire that parents, teaching professionals, the natural desire they have for certainty and clarity. But of course, this is an evolving situation and…



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:16:07] But we hear talk of a plan possibly to be announced tomorrow of a tutoring system through the summer or a school summer plan, what can you tell us?

James Cleverly



[00:16:13] Well, you’re going to have to wait for the announcement because that would be the right thing to do, I don’t want to steal the thunder of my colleagues from the Department of Education. But the point is that we are evolving the plan as we learn more about the nature of the virus – we’ve got to make sure that the students are safe, the teaching professionals are safe, and so this will mean that we are having to adapt. And that is disconcerting, it’s hugely disconcerting for parents. We completely understand that. But we want to make sure that children don’t miss out on their education – education’s incredibly important. And it’s not just about the syllabus, it’s also about the social interactions. And so we want to make sure that we can really establish training provision in a way that’s safe for the students, for the staff, for the training professionals and, of course, their families.



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:17:09] Isn’t it confusing, though, for parents and students alike when there was a plan announced…if I recall, it was that schools would go back on 1st June and Michael Gove said it was safe for them to go back on 1st June. And it was predicated on having, I hate to use the phrase, a world-beating test and trace system – there’s been a failure to achieve that.



 



James Cleverly



Well…

Jed Mercurio



[00:17:36] We need safety to be achieved through having a functioning test and trace system, and low levels of transmission, because it’s not just about it being safe for kids to go back to school, it has to be safe for society. They travel, they interact with staff; those staff members interact with people in their households and possibly the disease can be transmitted to vulnerable people. So, there has been a total failure to deliver on the promises, and that’s caused a great deal of confusion.



 



James Cleverly



[00:18:10] Well, I’m going to have to disagree with you on the point you’re making about the requirement for test and trace and the planning around that and the delivery of that. We’ve got…we now have a testing system which tests huge numbers of people on a daily basis, hundreds of thousands of people. And that was driven forward…Matt Hancock set himself some incredibly challenging targets to expand that.

Tony



[00:18:48] Yes, hello. One of the things that bugs me about all this is, everything comes down to that government has to have a plan, and the government does have to have a plan but some of the ideas that come through are frankly just incomprehensible. I was just listening today to somebody saying, the problem is, we don’t have enough space. We can open hotels, we can put up marquees and that way we can get more kids back into school. Great idea; begs the question where are the teachers, because we wouldn’t have enough teachers to do that, and those teachers we have got about 40 per cent of them don’t want to go back anyway.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:19:30] Sue?



 



Sue



[00:19:31] We all know that education is a great social leveller and a great force for social mobility, and with rising inequality in the UK the fact that these children… The question was whether six months off school is devastating for a whole generation and for those children who have no access to the internet, have no computers at school, have no books on the book shelves behind them, these are the children who are particularly suffering from this. And until we have, I’m sorry to repeat it, but effective tracing in place…testing and tracing, we can’t get there. We cannot have, like on the Isle of Wight, 90 per cent of those people who are traced disappearing into the ether.

Fiona Bruce



[00:20:15] Deborah, you’ve got your hand up.



 



Deborah Norrish



[00:20:18] Just coming back to James about the points, and the vision to get students back into school, which is exactly what we all want, the implementation of some of the policies that the government have suggested haven’t necessarily turned out to what they were planned – so the school laptops, for example, our school our disadvantage laptops still haven’t arrived. And today I know the announcement with the big catch-up plan and the national tutoring programme in theory sounds fabulous; in reality have we got capacity to be able to implement what the government are trying to suggest?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:20:51] Lisa?



 



Lisa Nandy



[00:20:52] Well, I mean, the question was about trying to…about the impact on children, and I think there’s no question that this is going to have a big impact on this generation. It’s not just about exam results and life chances, as important as that is, but health professionals are increasingly worried that this is having a real impact on children’s mental health as well. So, for every reason, we ought to be trying to get children back to school as quickly as can safely be achieved. It’s why it’s been so frustrating to see the government’s response to this entering into this blame game and refusing to work with people to build a national consensus around this.

I think we could sort this out pretty quickly actually, it’s a huge effort and it takes a lot of work to get children back to school safely with the social distancing requirements. But if you think back to when we were trying to get the public health efforts off the ground, and the government did concede that they needed to work with a wide variety of partners – the army was brought in to help construct hospitals, we had people being brought back out of retirement in order to help boost the workforce – we need a similarly comparable effort for education. We’ve had efforts around health, we’ve had efforts around the economy, but education has really been the poor relation here.

[00:22:09] But, Lisa, is Labour’s position slightly…



 



Lisa Nandy

Fiona Bruce



[00:22:10] Lisa, I’m so sorry to interrupt but, Lisa, is Labour’s position slightly confusing? You have the Shadow Education Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey saying only last week that it was welcome that the government was rowing back from full school reopening plans before summer.

Lisa Nandy



[00:22:25] Well, it’s welcome that they’re not trying to force schools to reopen when it’s not safe to do so. And actually, this is why months ago we were calling for the government to have an exit strategy from lockdown and to start working on that now, because the countries that have managed to get children back to school more quickly were planning for this several months ago. They’ve also done a lot more to try and get support to children in the meantime so that when children do go back to school, we’re not dealing with this enormous attainment gap. The government promised laptops and internet connections months ago but we’re just still not seeing them delivered around the country.



 



We had a plan announced today that said that there’d be private tutoring available. Now, I really welcome this, but once again, school leaders have been left wringing their hands, saying, why haven’t you spoken to us before you announce these plans? We’ve had enough of back-of-the-envelope plans; we need a proper national strategy and a national consensus; we need the government to reach out and work with schools in order to get children back to school as quickly as possible.

[00:23:25] And, Steve, there seems to be an element of some schools kind of ploughing their own furrow. Private schools have been talking over the last couple of days that they’re going to get their own kind of app going and that they are committed to getting all children back in school by September.



 



Steve Parish



[00:23:37] Well, look, I would say…I would agree with Lisa on a lot of things. We don’t seem to have a strategy to exit the lockdown in any industry. You know, we are fortunate enough in football that we have the resources and the money to develop our own strategy and we can test players twice a week, and we have a fairly limited requirement without supporters.



 



This virus most likely will stay with us in this guise for the foreseeable future. We all hope for a vaccine, we hope for better interventions but we know they’re not likely to come. If the lockdown worked, which we all think it did, when we come out of lockdown the infections will rise. And if we can’t track those infections down and trace them and quell those outbreaks, we really are in for a terrible time economically.

And coming back to the original question, I would say that there will be limited damage done to everything if we can get back to as close to normal as possible by September. But if we don’t get back to as close to normal in September, our children, our businesses, our children’s future will be damaged for maybe ten, 15 years. So, the next two or three months are such a crucial period. It does require everybody to stop the blame game; it requires a massive massive national effort, and a ‘can do’ mentality and attitude that worries me we seem to have lost in this country. And if we don’t do that, I think we really are in serious problems.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:25:03] Well, look you’ve mentioned it, and you mentioned it as well, Jed, in terms of contact tracing and that being a method for moving us all forward – we’ve got a question on that, so let’s come to it. Gareth Jones?

Gareth Jones



[00:25:15] Good evening. The current app development is experiencing problems – if we don’t get it working, does it really matter? Will it make a difference to prevent a second wave?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:25:25] Does it really matter, Lisa Nandy?



 



Lisa Nandy



[00:25:27] Yeah, I think it does matter and, you know, we very much supported the government in trying to set this up, because in the end if you get the app up and running it will save lives. The problem is that the government were warned repeatedly from the outset that the path that they were taking was not going to work because the technology just wasn’t compatible with a lot of phones. Now, there were other countries like Germany and Australia, who were taking a similar path to our government, trying to develop their own technology, realised that it wouldn’t work, listened to those warnings, and actually went down a different path. And as a result Germany has just managed to launch their app yesterday and is quite confident about how that’s going to work. So, we’ve really got to start breaking the pattern here, which is of a government that shuts people out, doesn’t listen to advice, doesn’t seek to learn from expertise here in the UK and overseas, and then finds later that they’ve got to revisit those plans because they’ve unravelled very very quickly. We’ve seen it over and over again with a whole host of things.

One of the real outstanding problems with all of this at the moment is that you’ve got public health directors across England saying that they still don’t get…the GPs in local areas don’t get the results of tests. Because the government set up their own private sector testing facilities around the country, so GPs just simply don’t know whether their patients are testing positive for COVID. Public health directors are looking closely at local outbreaks and having to make decisions about managing local outbreaks, but because they’re not getting that information, they just simply don’t have the tools that they need to do the job. So, we need a reset here. It’s right for the government to abandon a system if it isn’t working, but we need to ask ourselves, why is it so often that we end up having to unravel plans over and over again because we didn’t get them right in the first place?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:27:20] Yeah, and, Steve, I wanted to ask you not only what you think about this particular question but also just tell us a little bit about how you’re managing at Crystal Palace, because you’ve got a kind of app of your own there, haven’t you?

Steve Parish



[00:27:39] Yes, it’s not a tracing app. I mean, on the app it seems incredible to me that so many countries are developing their own app. I mean, I would’ve thought, certainly, if the EU has a purpose that that might be one thing that they could’ve got everybody’s heads together on. We all want exactly the same app doing exactly the same thing, which seems incredible. We have a very simple app where the players and the staff fill in any symptoms, because that’s as efficient a way of catching the disease early. Sometimes there’s testing, where there can be a lag between the time you test and testing positive.



 



But, you know, developing these apps is extremely complex. You know, as somebody who had a business that developed this kind of thing, the time scales that we’re trying to do it in are very very compressed. I’m pleased today that they’re adapting to Google and Apple technology, which, you know, I would hazard a guess they might be better at producing stuff than, you know, people in our government. So, look, let’s hope that we can all get together. The blame game on both sides, I think, really does need to stop. It’s a very difficult situation, nobody was prepared for this situation. You know, we can say Germany have done slightly less worse than everybody else. We’ll need to look back on…

[00:28:43] They have done better in terms of their death toll, but I think when we look back on this, 10,000 deaths is too many. You know, for this to get to the extent that it did into the amount of countries that it has. You know, the world really needs to look at it and make sure that these kind of outbreaks are jumped on way before the kind of things we’re discussing now, because we are talking about a pandemic that is broadly out of control in the world that we’re trying to get on top of, and it is going to be extremely difficult. And we do need to come together as a country, private enterprise, the governments, both sides of the House and try and find a solution in the next two or three months, or we really could be in a terrible situation.

[00:29:48] Yes. It just seems that this is just another moment of government bluster actually hitting reality. So, Matt Hancock and Baroness Harding said today that they’ve backed both horses of the Google and the android model and the NHS app, but they’ve always insisted until this point that they were only going to pursue the NHS app. So it just seems that the government are trying to make it seem that they’re trying to do the best job possible, but when it comes to reality they might cover up and not pretend that they’ve done anything wrong.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:30:19] Jed?



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:30:20] Well, I think that the app can only really be an adjunct. I think that there are technological limitations in the app in terms of providing a nation-wide service. And really, it’s about having a functioning public health infrastructure that is able to deal with local outbreaks locally. And unfortunately, the government has chosen to centralise and use a private company, Cerco, to take the lead on this. And I think that a lot of public health officials and workers, as Lisa said, are frustrated that they’re not receiving the information.

 They’ve kind of been shut out, whether intentionally or not I don't know, but they do feel that they’ve been shut out. And that does then limit us in terms of our ability to do exactly what we’re all asking for.



 



As Steve said, where’s that can do attitude? Can we crush this virus so that society can get back to normal and our kids can get back into school and our businesses can get up and running? And a lot of the businesses and the particular sectors that are looking to get back, frankly, don’t have much confidence.

[00:31:30] And what about your business? I mean, getting Line of Duty – I say that as an unashamed fan I have to confess, of getting that back up and running?



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:31:37] Well, it’s interesting that you give that specific example because we had an outbreak during the shoot over in Belfast when there was the test and trace system originally, the containment phase, and we were able to deal with that and we were able to carry on uninterrupted. Then, towards the end of the shoot that got curtailed, we had another outbreak and I was quite surprised to learn that we weren’t able to do testing and tracing, that the system had been stopped. And that was the point where really when we looked at it, we knew that we couldn’t protect our workforce and we had to stop, and that was nine days before the lockdown. So the writing was on the wall then.

And I think a lot of businesses are just going to take responsibility for it themselves. I think that each TV production will organise their own testing and they will look after each other and do their best that way.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:32:32] And James, obviously, we had the announcement today from the Health Secretary about switching horses, I think was the analogy that Matt Hancock used, having…but he also said we backed both horses throughout, the NHSX app and also this other app, kind of Google-Apple app. What I don’t understand about that is if the government has been backing both those things, it’s now jettisoned one, why isn’t the other one ready?



 



James Cleverly



[00:33:00] Well, the…I mean, these apps…we talk about…I mean, Lisa implies there was an obvious right answer – there clearly wasn’t an obvious right answer.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:33:12] Yeah, but if you’ve been backing them both and other countries are already introducing their apps, how come the other one isn’t ready?



 



James Cleverly



[00:33:17] So, the idea that there was an obvious right answer is wrong, otherwise every country in the world would’ve done the same thing and that’s not what happened, Germany as an example. And what Matt did was exactly the right thing to do, which is not to put all our eggs in one basket, to make sure that we were developing, you know, the in-house app, as it were, and the app through third parties. And it was test…

James Cleverly



[00:33:43] And it was tested on the Isle of Wight and a decision was made to go with the other option. That’s the right thing to do, and it’s about learning as we go through this and making the decision. I don't know exactly when the app will go live.



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:33:59] Because we heard it might not be till winter now.



 



James Cleverly



[00:34:01] But…so as I say, I don’t want to guess and speculate, I don't know exactly when the app will go live. But obviously, we will continue working with international friends and partners, we will learn from what other countries are doing. And we are…the whole world is learning as we go, and to make sure that we bring about a test and trace app that can be used to protect us all.



 



Fiona Bruce

Gareth Jones



[00:34:28] Yeah, do you not think that the public are going to see this as another U‑turn again, and it’s going to be even harder to get the public on board to actually use the app when it does become live?

James Cleverly



[00:34:44] We use the word U-turn… I mean, I was in business before I came into politics and if you’re going to test a couple of options, see which one progresses best, see which one works and then invest your time and effort in the better performing one of those options, that’s not a U-turn. That’s why it was tested on the Isle of Wight. That’s why we are…you know, we learn from the experience…

Fiona Bruce



[00:35:46] So we haven’t trialled it, but we’re relying on other countries.

Munira Wilson



[00:36:10] I can’t overstate how important getting test and trace right, and getting it right as quickly as possible is. Everybody who’s watching this evening is desperate to try and get back to some sense of normality. Without a robust operational test and trace system it’s impossible to be able to do that safely; we have to be able to find every case and isolate it and keep the…and suppress this virus.



 



What is very clear to me is when I had a conversation with the Deputy Chief Medical Officer on 13th March it was around then that we stopped routinely testing and tracing every incidence of coronavirus. And I questioned her hard and I said why are you stopping the testing, we should be testing every case? And it was down to capacity, and it’s been far too late. It was some weeks after that that we suddenly saw a focus on ramping up testing. And, great, we’ve got the capacity but, James, we haven’t had for almost a month now the figures of how many people have actually been tested on a daily basis.

And on tracing, as Lisa has said, we need to be working much more closely with local authorities. Directors of public health have been crying out to be leading this effort; they are the experts. I didn’t watch the Salisbury Poisonings earlier this week but I heard in there it showed just how pivotal the role of the Director of Public Health is. That is what they should be doing, that’s what they’re experts in and they should be leading those teams of contact tracers to be tracing every case. But last week I was talking to some leaders in local government, they haven’t got the data, they haven’t got the tools. They’re still to some extent unclear about what their roles should be, and this is absolutely critical if we want to open up our economy again.



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:38:01] I think it’s telling that you got an honest answer about the reason that testing was abandoned in March. What we were told…the public was told was that it wasn’t appropriate for an economy of our size.

Steve Parish



[00:38:14] Well, I think that our institutions…I feel, you know, we talk about the government all the time letting us down but, you know, Public Health England made that decision. In Germany, they devolved it very quickly into the local authorities. And I would also say, I mean, we can’t have the whole of the United Kingdom hanging on an app developer developing an app. You know, test and trace is possible to do manually. Most of it, Jed, as you said, will happen manually, even with the app. The app is 15minutes in proximity of two metres to somebody.



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:38:41] Yeah, it’s just an adjunct, but you’ve got to have the whole infrastructure.

[00:38:44] You can remember if you were with somebody for 15 minutes.



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:38:46] Yeah.

[00:38:46] So, you know, we need to get test and trace rolled out manually and if the app comes along and helps us do it then great, but we can’t wait for that.

Steve Parish



[00:38:54] But it’s also about people receiving accurate information. When you have public health officials, when you have government scientists saying things which are manifestly untrue, which is that it wasn’t appropriate, it was actually always about resources but they didn’t admit that. And so now we’re in a situation again where trust has broken down. People are desperate to get good quality information they can rely on from their government, from their public health officials, so that people can make the right decisions and make the right calculations about risk about how we get back to normal.



 



Munira Wilson

Munira Wilson



[00:39:34] Okay. You talked about ending the blame game. I think the public appreciate that we are in an unprecedented situation and no government is going to get it right. But the thing that frustrates me most about this government is that they just don’t have the humility to put their hands up when they’ve actually got it wrong, or they’ve been too late.

That is the blame game, that’s exactly what it is.



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:40:01] No, but there’s…isn’t there a difference between making a U-turn on policy and just lying? There’s a difference between those two things.



 



Steve Parish



[00:40:07] Well, I certainly think that the information, as you just pointed out, that they’ve received from some of our institutions of science… And I’m not here to defend them blindly – everybody’s made terrible mistakes, you know, where there was a left turn to make, we took the right one on almost every occasion and we have to learn from it. But I don't think when we look back there’ll be any one single reason, you know.



 



Jed Mercurio



[00:40:28] Oh, you’re absolutely right, Steve, absolutely, yeah.

[00:40:30] And I think we have to consider that when we move forward, and that’s the most important thing is how we move forward.

And unfortunately, there’s that gap between the learning behaviour and the transmission of the information about what has been learned and where mistakes were made. And I think that that is problematic for people to have confidence about the information they receive and how they go forward.



 



Fiona Bruce

Laura Hill



[00:41:04] Earlier this week, the Prime Minister announced a review into racial inequality in the country. Isn’t it time for action rather than just another review?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:41:15] Munira?



 



Munira Wilson



[00:41:16] Absolutely, and it was unfortunate that the announcement was buried in a piece about Winston Churchill’s statue. People are angry, people are hurting. That’s why despite the fact that we’ve got a public health emergency and nobody wants to see crowds out on the street, people feel moved to go out and protest, having been outraged by what they’ve seen happen in the US with George Floyd, but also with the huge inequalities that have been exposed by the virus, and we’ve seen the BAME community disproportionately affected.

Fiona Bruce



[00:41:54] So, specifically, what action do you think should be taken?



 



Munira Wilson



[00:41:58] Well, there’s a whole…there’s already been a whole host of reviews where the recommendations have yet to be implemented. And in terms of the Home Office, ending the hostile environment would be a good place to start, for instance. There’s also things like suspicion-less stop and search – we know that black individuals are 47 times more likely to be stopped and searched.



 



And I received last week a letter about a 15-year-old mixed race boy in my constituency, a law-abiding young man, I heard from his head teacher, and he has been stopped countless times by the police, they’re convinced it’s racial profiling. Even when he’s been out with his white friends, the police have stopped him to question him but not his white friends. His parents are terrified that at some point he’s going to get into more trouble because he’s going to react to being stopped. This shouldn’t be happening.



 



And clearly, there are systemic issues that need to be tackled, and that’s where, you know, David Lammy’s review, we’re still waiting for some of those recommendations to be implemented. So yes, another review is important, but it shouldn’t just be a research project, it should be setting goals and targets and measures for us to be tracking progress against.

[00:43:15] I mean, James, I just had a little look through the number of reviews that there have been, and by my counting anyway there have been eight reviews in the last three years looking into race or the effect of race as part of a bigger project – why do you need another one?



 



James Cleverly



[00:43:29] Well, reviews are how governments learn about what needs to change or needs to…

James Cleverly



[00:43:39] Yeah, look, I’m not…I’m not going to suggest that the government should stop learning and stop understanding, so I’m comfortable with reviews. And actually I’m very proud of the fact that I’m part of a government that has made some real differences. So, for example, and I know these figures will now be distorted because of the situation with the coronavirus, but up until that point, the increase in employment had disproportionately benefitted people from black and other minority groups. And having a job, I think we’ll all agree, is a foundation stone for a better life.

We have looked at the impact of stop and search. When I worked with Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London, we looked at how crime disproportionately affect black Londoners, and he’s carried that passion now with him into Downing Street. And it’s easy when people say, oh, you know, we should do something, and when asked what exactly we should do, you are able to give an answer, because it is not simple and it is not the kind of change that can happen overnight. But I’m incredibly proud of the work that the Prime Minister has done both as prime minister and as mayor of London to try and close the gap between the lives…the lived experience of ethnic minorities in the UK and the norm.

Marsha



[00:45:10] Can I just say, after you’ve mentioned that there’s been eight areas, I think reviews aren’t enough, it’s time now for reform. And I think we should start at least by educating children in school about black culture and black history, so that it can start there.

I think…I mean, too many people…if you’re saying that a 15-year-old was stopped several times by the police and it was racial profiling, that doesn’t come from one specific police officer, that comes from the whole attitude of people in general…police officers in general. And they didn’t go to the police force with that attitude, I think that came from the way they were brought up or things that they’ve learned, you know, in their lives as they’ve grown up. I think if people had a different attitude towards black people as they grow up, it would start there.

That’s why they’re on the streets, that’s why it’s brought them out on the streets to… Though, like you said, eight reviews and what has changed for them? All that I see is that there’s a lot of section of this nation getting disenfranchised with the whole scenario. They want to see change and there are things that can be done. You know, they could teach the children about black history in school, they can introduce culture…black culture and ethnic culture into the curriculum. It’s their country, people have got to be made to feel like it’s their country, but they’re not.

And like the audience member said about it’s time for action, and just the previous comment then shows a certain element of ignorance about what is actually happening right now. As a teacher, you know, our curriculum changed and was reduced to become English heritage. And it’s not just about black history that needs to be learned, it’s about our history, our Anglocentric history warts and all, that needs to be learned from – but also needs to be put into learning now so that we don’t have each generations with similar attitudes that would just perpetuate this.

[00:49:47] Steve, let me bring you back to Laura’s original question. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister announced a review into racial inequality in the country – isn’t now the time for action rather than just another review?



 



Steve Parish



[00:50:00] I absolutely think it’s time for action. I mean, you know, we have some experience of this; we have a big academy with 212 boys in it at any one time and, you know, there are many many facets of this problem that we all accept exists. One of the biggest ones that I see is really based around social mobility. And the frustrating thing for me is that we all have it in our power to make a difference. You know, again, this is one of those things we can put to government, or we can make a change. And, you know, what I see in the boys that we’ve got is that they don’t have…even if they’re, you know, academically strong or bright, they don’t have the networks that we have. They don’t get the opportunities that people in our network get.

And all of the people that were involved in the protests, you know, from the privileged side of the debate, if you like, can all make a difference. They all run companies, they own companies, they can give opportunities, whether it’s work experience, internships, to help people along the road on the journey. And we can start making a difference now, we can all individually start making a difference tomorrow, and we know we can. And we don’t need to wait for a government review to do it. The government review may help, it may come up with things that we can do with the police and to change attitudes.



 



I certainly think, having looked at this whole issue of history and statues, that we need to review some things. You know, I think if we wouldn’t put a statue up of that person now, why would we continue to have it? You know, do we want a statue to a man who brought 90,000 slaves into the country and killed 19,000 of them? You know, not for me; whilst I think that there are people like Churchill who, although misguided in some beliefs at the time, overall were a force for good.



 



So, I’d like to see real change, I’d like to see us grasp the moment that we’ve got and have some kind of way that we bring about more equality, certainly in the work place.

[00:51:55] I think Steve’s said so many important things there, and we’ve heard a lot of really great points as well. I’d like to maybe bring in a timely example, because there was a recent review which looked at the effects of COVID. And one of the troubling findings was about the vulnerability of certain ethnicities to coronavirus, specifically in terms of frontline healthcare staff. And I certainly think that an opportunity was missed to look at the risks that people are experiencing based on their ethnicity, and whether there should be redeployment of some staff, whether there should be changes in roles, and that should be factored in.

[00:53:05] Well, I was a bit concerned to hear Tony saying that the way that the Black Lives Matters protestors conduct themselves doesn’t help their cause, because I’ve been tremendously inspired actually by a lot of the young people who’ve come out and taken to the streets in recent weeks. And I think that they’re standing up and using their voice and the platform that they have in order to try and get change while generation after generation have been failed.



 



You know, James said, well, you know, what do you actually want to be done? But the government itself has sponsored four reviews in the last four years which have made 201 recommendations; those recommendations actually have common themes to them. It’s about changing recruitment practices so we get far better representation at every level in the criminal justice system, in work places and across society. It’s about having a better education system so that people understand how discrimination actually works and understand the complexity of the history that we’ve got.

It’s about having better legal representation. It’s about incomes as well. We were just talking about child poverty, but actually if you’re black you’re more likely to be poor, you’re more likely to be stopped by the police. There are real disparities in the immigration system as well. These are things that should be well known to any politician of any party, and the key thing now is that we get on and implement them. You can see why people are so frustrated.



 



And I would just say this as well, my dad’s generation were amongst those who fought for greater racial equality in this country and they did make huge strides forward. And the way that they did it in the end was through leadership, people like Roy Jenkins, who stepped forward in order to bring in the Race Relations Act. Now, that was at a time when that was actually deeply controversial and pretty unpopular in Britain.



 



What I would say to James is, I think that the government’s inaction is based on a very dim view of people in this country. Most people in this country now strongly believe that discrimination harms all of us even if we’re not directly affected by it – we care about one another, we’re a tolerant society. And the government really does need to get on and implement recommendations from those reports, not just kick this into the long grass, because if we’ve learned anything over the last few weeks, it just will not cut it any more.

[00:55:17] James, I promised I’d let you back in.



 



James Cleverly



[00:55:18] Yeah, thank you. I am not…and I would never suggest that there isn’t improvement that can be made, there’s a huge amount of improvement that can be made, but to imply that we’ve not progressed is just factually wrong and deeply insulting. Steve and I grew up in South East London and although he’s infinitely better looking, he’s a couple of years older, I remember when the National Front marched through my…the streets virtually where I live.

…Two hundred and one recommendations, in the last…



 



James Cleverly



[00:56:42] I have mentored black people in business, black people in the civil service – we are moving in the right direction. And yes, we should always aspire to move further and faster, but we must never deny the progress that we’ve made. Otherwise, unsurprisingly, young people…young black people in Britain will think that there has been no progress, and that’s just wrong, it’s wrong.

[0:01:16] I welcome the easing of lockdown so people can move on with their lives. Lives is all about risks and we've been under the complete control of the State since March 21st, is it not time to allow people who are aware of the risks now to make decisions about how they want to approach this situation.

I don't think any one of us wants to be kept locked up but the reality is if we hadn't had the lockdown, many of us.wouldn't be here today, especially oldies like me. I think we have had to endure that, and we have to come out of this sooner rather than later, I totally agree because otherwise we are going to have a lot of unintended consequences, that's things that will be a lot worse than possibly, you know, some minor out breaks of the actual virus. So. It's important we come out now. It's important that we adopt the new normal, because, it is a new normal.

I think we have had to endure that, and we have to come out of this sooner rather than later, I totally agree because otherwise we are going to have a lot of unintended consequences, that's things that will be a lot worse than possibly, you know, some minor out breaks of the actual virus. So. It's important we come out now. It's important that we adopt the new normal, because, it is a new normal.

Given we live in a free, liberal society?

I don't think any one of us wants to be kept locked up but the reality is if we hadn't had the lockdown, many of us.wouldn't be here today, especially oldies like me. I think we have had to endure that, and we have to come out of this sooner rather than later, I totally agree because otherwise we are going to have a lot of unintended consequences, that's things that will be a lot worse than possibly, you know, some minor out breaks of the actual virus.

Lives is all about risks and we've been under the complete control of the State since March 21st, is it not time to allow people who are aware of the risks now to make decisions about how they want to approach this situation. Given we live in a free, liberal society?

[0:01:46] I think they were trying to keep us safe. I don't think any one of us wants to be kept locked up but the reality is if we hadn't had the lockdown, many of us.wouldn't be here today, especially oldies like me. I think we have had to endure that, and we have to come out of this sooner rather than later, I totally agree because otherwise we are going to have a lot of unintended consequences, that's things that will be a lot worse than possibly, you know, some minor out breaks of the actual virus. So. It's important we come out now. It's important that we adopt the new normal, because, it is a new normal.

It's actually the cost of the average energy bill, so this is a huge cost to my constituents and many millions of people across the country, and it's a choice, and it's coming alongside an increase of course in national insurance.

If you're a carer and thank God for our carers in the last 18 months, or you're a nurse or you work in a prison and you've kept COVID from breaking out right across the prison, you're on 18 thousand pounds a year, that cut means 1100 a year that you now have to pay. It's actually the cost of the average energy bill, so this is a huge cost to my constituents and many millions of people across the country, and it's a choice, and it's coming alongside an increase of course in national insurance. Economists are predicting an inflation rise, and certainly interest rates going up by next February, so this is mean, it's nasty, it's unnecessary and there should have been a U turn.

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:20] So let's start with our first question tonight, which is from Alison Goldie.

Alison Goldie

[0:01:26] Good evening, Fiona, good evening Panel. So given the success of track and trace we rely significantly on the public's trust and the Government and compliance with the rules. Does the Panel feel this has been undermined in any way by the events of this last week?

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:46] Gosh! It feels like we have done nothing else but talk about the events of the last week and of course Dominic Cummings. Ian Murray.

Ian Murray

[0:01:56] Well, thank you for the question, Alison. I think it gets tothe nub of how we get out of pandemic. The way we get out of that is test, track, trace and isolate. That's the only way without a vaccine we were going to be able to go forward. With the saga we have had last week, the Prime Minister and Government, his integrity is in tatters. We have seen it is one rule for the Prime Minister and his team and one rule for the public.

[0:01:26] Good evening, Fiona, good evening Panel. So given the success of track and trace we rely significantly on the public's trust and the Government and compliance with the rules. Does the Panel feel this has been undermined in any way by the events of this last week?

[0:01:46] Gosh! It feels like we have done nothing else but talk about the events of the last week and of course Dominic Cummings. Ian Murray.

[0:01:56] Well, thank you for the question, Alison. I think it gets tothe nub of how we get out of pandemic. The way we get out of that is test, track, trace and isolate. That's the only way without a vaccine we were going to be able to go forward. With the saga we have had last week, the Prime Minister and Government, his integrity is in tatters. We have seen it is one rule for the Prime Minister and his team and one rule for the public.

[0:01:20] So let's start with our first question tonight, which is from Alison Goldie.

[0:01:26] Good evening, Fiona, good evening Panel. So given the success of track and trace we rely significantly on the public's trust and the Government and compliance with the rules. Does the Panel feel this has been undermined in any way by the events of this last week?

[0:01:46] Gosh! It feels like we have done nothing else but talk about the events of the last week and of course Dominic Cummings. Ian Murray.

[0:01:56] Well, thank you for the question, Alison. I think it gets tothe nub of how we get out of pandemic. The way we get out of that is test, track, trace and isolate. That's the only way without a vaccine we were going to be able to go forward. With the saga we have had last week, the Prime Minister and Government, his integrity is in tatters. We have seen it is one rule for the Prime Minister and his team and one rule for the public.

[0:00:06] Thank you, Fiona. Welcome, Panel. Was Boris's nonaction against Matt Hancock yet another missed opportunity to show leadership and set the standard for social distancing?

David Davis

[0:00:20] I don't think so. With all these things, when somebody falls from grace, there's almost a lynch mob in the press. I watched this, I thought it was plain that Matt was going to go. But Boris, I think, made a number of decisions. I'm just reading his mind, the same way you would.

David Davis

[0:00:50] He's an ex-journalist. He knows some don't pursue the truth, they are pursuer of headlines. He knows he is talking about replacing his most important Cabinet member, really, at this point in the middle of this crisis. He knows he is talking about the fate of two families and six children, and so on. I expect what he was doing was creating time for the -- for Matt Hancock to make his own decision. That's what I suspect was going on. I don't know, but that's what I suspect. Frankly, if a Prime Minister shows some loyalty, even perhaps unwise loyalty to a subordinate, I think that's a good thing.

[0:00:50] He's an ex-journalist. He knows some don't pursue the truth, they are pursuer of headlines.

That's what I suspect was going on. I don't know, but that's what I suspect.
