[00:02:46] That’s the question everyone is asking at the moment. It is fantastic news that we’ve got the vaccine. It really is a moment to be proud, to be proud of all the scientists across the world working on all these vaccines and to have that light at the end of tunnel, when you are putting up your Christmas decorations you can think there will be an end to this because the vaccine is coming. It is brilliant. We know, and the scientists have been clear in the press conference with the prime minister, this is going to be very challenging logistically. Firstly, how is it going to be delivered and to whom. Of course, there are tiers of people that are going to get it first. But I don’t know about you, but my MP WhatsApp groups have been buzzing all day with people saying we heard there’s going to be a hospital here doing it, a hospital there, but what about our area?

[00:03:28] Thank you. Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca insist there is no shortage of vaccines. There, instead, appears to be a huge blockage in our ability to deploy the vaccine effectively and appears to stem from a lack of joined up planning and a refusal to use all the resources available to us. If Israel can manage 16,000 vaccinations every day, why can’t we do better?

Fiona Bruce

[00:03:58] Why can’t we, Nadhim.

Nadhim Zahawi

[00:04:02] Thank you very much for the question. So, the NHS in England and Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland have put together a delivery plan. We started on 8 December with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a vaccine that has to travel at minus 70 degrees Centigrade. We rolled out into primary care which is the most effective way to get to the most vulnerable, which we were focussing on which is the over 80s. We have now vaccinated 1 quarter, 25 percent of people who are over 80. In two weeks’ time they will have that protection when the vaccine begins to really take effect.

Nadhim Zahawi

[00:04:02] Thank you very much for the question. So, the NHS in England and Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland have put together a delivery plan. We started on 8 December with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a vaccine that has to travel at minus 70 degrees Centigrade. We rolled out into primary care which is the most effective way to get to the most vulnerable, which we were focussing on which is the over 80s. We have now vaccinated 1 quarter, 25 percent of people who are over 80. In two weeks’ time they will have that protection when the vaccine begins to really take effect.

[00:03:28] Thank you. Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca insist there is no shortage of vaccines. There, instead, appears to be a huge blockage in our ability to deploy the vaccine effectively and appears to stem from a lack of joined up planning and a refusal to use all the resources available to us. If Israel can manage 16,000 vaccinations every day, why can’t we do better?

We rolled out into primary care which is the most effective way to get to the most vulnerable, which we were focussing on which is the over 80s. We have now vaccinated 1 quarter, 25 percent of people who are over 80. In two weeks’ time they will have that protection when the vaccine begins to really take effect.

[00:03:28] Thank you. Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca insist there is no shortage of vaccines. There, instead, appears to be a huge blockage in our ability to deploy the vaccine effectively and appears to stem from a lack of joined up planning and a refusal to use all the resources available to us. If Israel can manage 16,000 vaccinations every day, why can’t we do better?

Right, let's start with our first question which is from Daniel Greening.

Daniel Greening

[00:01:26] Will we be allowed to go on a holiday this year abroad?

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:30] Will we, Vaughan?

Vaughan Gething

[00:01:32] I think it's impossible to say is the honest truth, and that's part of the difficult that we still face now. For all the progress we've made, and it's the hard-won sacrifices that people of Wales has meant we're in a position where coronavirus rates are now under 40 in 100,000, we know that in other parts of the world where we would normally have holidays the rates are rising, so mainland Europe in particular there are real challenges there

Audience Member

[0:01:14] Hi. Why has it taken until 15 February for the government to impose quarantine at the border. Why haven't lessons been learned from Australia who closed their border in the first wave and now have low levels of infection?

Ian Murray

[0:01:34] It is a great question, a question we have been asking in Parliament for the last year. We're an island nation and most other island nations across the world did better than us because they took the decision early to stop incoming traffic. We had the South Africa strain for 50-odd days. It is only now we take the decision to close down the borders. It's too late. There was a study by Aberdeen University which showed most of the deaths happened because of the inward variants coming in to Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. It seems, again, where both governments have been too slow to react.

Audience Member

[0:01:14] Hi. Why has it taken until 15 February for the government to impose quarantine at the border. Why haven't lessons been learned from Australia who closed their border in the first wave and now have low levels of infection?

Ian Murray

[0:01:34] It is a great question, a question we have been asking in Parliament for the last year. We're an island nation and most other island nations across the world did better than us because they took the decision early to stop incoming traffic. We had the South Africa strain for 50-odd days. It is only now we take the decision to close down the borders. It's too late. There was a study by Aberdeen University which showed most of the deaths happened because of the inward variants coming in to Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. It seems, again, where both governments have been too slow to react.

[0:03:30] Our first question tonight is from Becky Pierce.

AudienceMember 20210318QT01

[0:03:36] Sexism, harassment and violence against women continues to present a real and devastating threat to our safety and ultimately to our lives. When we will we learn that this is a problem for society and not a problem for women?

Fiona Bruce

[0:03:52] Becky, we are all absorbing the news about 32 year old Sara Everard who went missing last week. Are you asking this question from personal experience, Becky?

AudienceMember 20210318QT02

[0:04:04] I am, but also I don't think I know a single woman in my life who hasn't been sexually harassed or experienced some kind of negative attention be it from men, which is really, really saddening. It is just so common. It has almost become accepted. I think that women face real restrictions in their lives and what they can do.

AudienceMember 20210318QT02

[0:04:04] I am, but also I don't think I know a single woman in my life who hasn't been sexually harassed or experienced some kind of negative attention be it from men, which is really, really saddening.

Fiona Bruce

[0:03:30] Our first question tonight is from Becky Pierce.

AudienceMember 20210318QT01

[0:03:36] Sexism, harassment and violence against women continues to present a real and devastating threat to our safety and ultimately to our lives. When we will we learn that this is a problem for society and not a problem for women?

Fiona Bruce

[0:03:52] Becky, we are all absorbing the news about 32 year old Sara Everard who went missing last week. Are you asking this question from personal experience, Becky?

AudienceMember 20210318QT02

[0:04:04] I am, but also I don't think I know a single woman in my life who hasn't been sexually harassed or experienced some kind of negative attention be it from men, which is really, really saddening. It is just so common. It has almost become accepted. I think that women face real restrictions in their lives and what they can do.

[0:00:00] Was the UK government right to send Royal Navy ships to Jersey amid tensions with French fisherman?

John Bercow

[0:00:10] No, it's an absurd act. Jingoistic sabre-rattling. If you tell me the despatch of those ships and the fact of election day today are unrelated, I can only say that you will believe anything. It is juvenile, it is downmarket, it is not constructive, it doesn't advance the cause of the arguments that need to be resolved. The truth of the matter is the problem flows, as so many things do, from Brexit. It isn't going to be addressed by a kind of Palmerstonian popularism. Frankly, Britain can do better than that.

[0:00:00] Was the UK government right to send Royal Navy ships to Jersey amid tensions with French fisherman?

John Bercow

[0:00:10] No, it's an absurd act. Jingoistic sabre-rattling. If you tell me the despatch of those ships and the fact of election day today are unrelated, I can only say that you will believe anything. It is juvenile, it is downmarket, it is not constructive, it doesn't advance the cause of the arguments that need to be resolved. The truth of the matter is the problem flows, as so many things do, from Brexit. It isn't going to be addressed by a kind of Palmerstonian popularism. Frankly, Britain can do better than that.

MATT HANCOCK

[00:13:30] The honest truth to that question is we don’t yet know. It is one of the many things we don’t yet know about the vaccine. The reason for that is in the trials that the vaccines, you test for how effective they are protecting the individual, also how safe they are. If they are safe and effective we can start to roll them out. The early data from the Pfizer vaccine looks like it is 90 percent effective protecting individuals. [DONE] That’s great. So if -- if -- it passes the safety data, and that is a big hurdle it still hasn’t gone over, then we can start rolling it out and it starts protecting people as soon as they’ve -- a week or so after the second dose.

[00:13:30] The honest truth to that question is we don’t yet know. It is one of the many things we don’t yet know about the vaccine. The reason for that is in the trials that the vaccines, you test for how effective they are protecting the individual, also how safe they are. If they are safe and effective we can start to roll them out. The early data from the Pfizer vaccine looks like it is 90 percent effective protecting individuals. [DONE] That’s great.

Arlene Foster

[00:02:18] The protocol was brought in by Boris Johnson to try to get Brexit done. By doing so, it separated Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom, something we warned about. Since the protocol came in, there have been difficulties with like steel, which we have worked to get sorted out, with pets’ travel, parcels, a whole range of items. We warned the prime minister about this which is why we voted against the withdrawal agreement. We said it was going to cause great difficulties. It arose because of a skewed understanding of the Belfast Agreement. What is really important to Northern Ireland is the trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, both ways. So it is important that we deal with all of the issues in the protocol. The prime minister said recently he will use Article 16 if necessary, and that means he will take unilateral action to protect the citizens and EXHURMS which citizens of Northern Ireland and we would urge him to work Ireland and we would urge him to work with us to make sure there isn’t damage to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.

[00:02:18] The protocol was brought in by Boris Johnson to try to get Brexit done. By doing so, it separated Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom, something we warned about. Since the protocol came in, there have been difficulties with like steel, which we have worked to get sorted out, with pets’ travel, parcels, a whole range of items. We warned the prime minister about this which is why we voted against the withdrawal agreement. We said it was going to cause great difficulties. It arose because of a skewed understanding of the Belfast Agreement. What is really important to Northern Ireland is the trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, both ways. So it is important that we deal with all of the issues in the protocol. The prime minister said recently he will use Article 16 if necessary, and that means he will take unilateral action to protect the citizens and EXHURMS which citizens of Northern Ireland and we would urge him to work Ireland and we would urge him to work with us to make sure there isn’t damage to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.

Since the protocol came in, there have been difficulties with like steel, which we have worked to get sorted out, with pets’ travel, parcels, a whole range of items. We warned the prime minister about this which is why we voted against the withdrawal agreement. We said it was going to cause great difficulties. It arose because of a skewed understanding of the Belfast Agreement. What is really important to Northern Ireland is the trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, both ways. So it is important that we deal with all of the issues in the protocol. The prime minister said recently he will use Article 16 if necessary, and that means he will take unilateral action to protect the citizens and EXHURMS which citizens of Northern Ireland and we would urge him to work Ireland and we would urge him to work with us to make sure there isn’t damage to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.

[00:01:10] Our first question tonight is from Blair [Wondin 01:22].



 



Blair Wondin



[00:01:22] Hello. If the main Scottish elections return a full independence government, what moral and legal right does the Westminster government have to deny another independence referendum? 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:01:32] Doug? 



 



Douglas Ross



[00:01:33] Well, I want to stop a pro-independence majority government, I want to stop the SNP having a majority at this election, as the Scottish Conservatives did five years ago. It was by people uniting behind the Scottish Conservatives that stopped that SNP majority in 2016, and people can do that again at this election.

It was by people uniting behind the Scottish Conservatives that stopped that SNP majority in 2016, and people can do that again at this election.

[0:00:48] The first question is from James alcock.

Audience Member A

[0:00:58] Why can you sit on a beverage on 8 March for a drink with a friend but you have to wait 35 days later to do it outside a licensed pub or restaurant? Social contact is no different. If anything, it's safer. Why are we waiting.

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:16] What's your feeling about this?

Audience Member B

[0:01:24] The social contact is no different. As much as I believe the British public want to do the right thing, the reality is, as an operator, I'll manage that for you, I'll make sure you're safe, that's what we do, we're experts in safety. If the guidelines are there to make sure people are 1.5, 2 metres apart, I'll do that for you. To make people manage that themselves, it is difficult.

[0:01:24] The social contact is no different. As much as I believe the British public want to do the right thing, the reality is, as an operator, I'll manage that for you, I'll make sure you're safe, that's what we do, we're experts in safety. If the guidelines are there to make sure people are 1.5, 2 metres apart, I'll do that for you. To make people manage that themselves, it is difficult.

[0:00:12] The issue is that the Northern Ireland protocol is a direct consequence of the type of Brexit that Boris Johnson and this government wanted to have. They didn't want to be part of the Customs Union or the single market or the other options and they don't want to align on food standards and veterinary standards which, if they were to align with the EU, which is what Biden is asking them to do, that would reduce many of the issues that we're seeing around the Northern Ireland protocol.

[0:00:00] Is the European Union having its sausages and eating it?

Fiona Bruce

[0:00:04] Lucy, we're talking about the Northern Ireland protocol.

Lucy Powell

[0:00:12] The issue is that the Northern Ireland protocol is a direct consequence of the type of Brexit that Boris Johnson and this government wanted to have. They didn't want to be part of the Customs Union or the single market or the other options and they don't want to align on food standards and veterinary standards which, if they were to align with the EU, which is what Biden is asking them to do, that would reduce many of the issues that we're seeing around the Northern Ireland protocol.

[00:00:00] Our first question from Tim.

AudienceMember 20210610QT01

[0:00:04] Good evening. The government is committed to 1.4 billion for the schools catchup. Are the government waiting for Marcus Rashford to step in before they sort the rest of the funding out?

Caroline Lucas

[0:10:50] Yes, it has returned, on steroids, I'm afraid. It really has been shocking to see the way in which Owen Paterson has been defended by the Prime Minister that, in a sense, we've abolished any kind of independent system of dealing with MPs' misconduct and instead we have the prospects of a new committee that was going to be a kangaroo court. There was going to be a built-in government majority on the new committee.

[0:10:46] Caroline Lucas.



Caroline Lucas

[0:10:50] Yes, it has returned, on steroids, I'm afraid. It really has been shocking to see the way in which Owen Paterson has been defended by the Prime Minister that, in a sense, we've abolished any kind of independent system of dealing with MPs' misconduct and instead we have the prospects of a new committee that was going to be a kangaroo court. There was going to be a built-in government majority on the new committee.

[0:10:50] Yes, it has returned, on steroids, I'm afraid. It really has been shocking to see the way in which Owen Paterson has been defended by the Prime Minister that, in a sense, we've abolished any kind of independent system of dealing with MPs' misconduct and instead we have the prospects of a new committee that was going to be a kangaroo court. There was going to be a built-in government majority on the new committee.

AudienceMember 20210916QT01

So, let’s start with our first question tonight, from our virtual audience, Tessa Marshall? 



Female Aud 1



[00:01:25] Okay.  So, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, will the panel commit to educating the citizens of the UK about the atrocities of the British Empire, take down the statues and the portraits that represent slave traders in the UK, and people who profited from Empire really.  And will you apologise for paying off the owners of slaves that the British people were paying off until as late as 2015? 



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:01:58] Robert? 



 



Robert Buckland



[00:01:50] Well, I think we’ve got to confront our history warts and all, and whilst there are many things we can be proud about with regard to Britain and its history, there’s a lot that we need to confront and be honest about, that is bad about our history.  But, I think that applying today’s standards to what may have happened many hundreds of years ago, is a difficult concept, to say the least.  And I think rather than using the language of blame and apology, we should be being honest about it, being forthright about it, using democratic processes wherever possible to deal with it.  So, let’s take for example, particular statues to slave traders, that might be in Bristol or elsewhere, use the democratic process to, through a proper decision, decide what to do with that particular memorial or statue…

AudienceMember 20210722QT22

[0:00:04] Hi there Fiona. Thank you. Yes my question is do you think it's double standards and hypocrisy allowing footballers, VIPs, in the UK without quarantining whilst lockdown is still in place? Which I kind of think is wrong.

Fiona Bruce

[0:00:22] So you obviously, you do think it's hypocritical, so this is about 2500 EUFA dignitaries and sponsors are going to be allowed to come to the Euros final without having to quarantine wherever they come from? Yes. You think it is hypocritical?

AudienceMember 20210722QT23

[0:00:36] Well it is. Because, the Government are asking us to stick by the rules, quarantine and do our Social Distancing and everything else and doing our tests. Yet they are still allowing people coming in from the UK into the UK, sorry, that are not having to quarantine. And that's wrong! On so many levels.

[0:00:00] Our first question tonight is from Dale Jackson.

AudienceMember 20210722QT22

[0:00:04] Hi there Fiona. Thank you. Yes my question is do you think it's double standards and hypocrisy allowing footballers, VIPs, in the UK without quarantining whilst lockdown is still in place? Which I kind of think is wrong.

Fiona Bruce

[0:00:22] So you obviously, you do think it's hypocritical, so this is about 2500 EUFA dignitaries and sponsors are going to be allowed to come to the Euros final without having to quarantine wherever they come from? Yes. You think it is hypocritical?

AudienceMember 20210722QT23

[0:00:36] Well it is. Because, the Government are asking us to stick by the rules, quarantine and do our Social Distancing and everything else and doing our tests. Yet they are still allowing people coming in from the UK into the UK, sorry, that are not having to quarantine. And that's wrong! On so many levels.

Yet they are still allowing people coming in from the UK into the UK, sorry, that are not having to quarantine. And that's wrong! On so many levels.

[0:00:04] Hi there Fiona. Thank you. Yes my question is do you think it's double standards and hypocrisy allowing footballers, VIPs, in the UK without quarantining whilst lockdown is still in place? Which I kind of think is wrong.

Fiona Bruce

[0:00:22] So you obviously, you do think it's hypocritical, so this is about 2500 EUFA dignitaries and sponsors are going to be allowed to come to the Euros final without having to quarantine wherever they come from? Yes. You think it is hypocritical?

[00:01:40] Thank you, Fiona. Do you think that this pandemic has been managed better by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland than it has by Boris Johnson in England?

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:52] Kate.

Kate Forbes

[00:01:54] Well, I don’t think it is a competition because every government is responsible with the trust of the people to manage this pandemic in a way that sees the virus suppressed and also trying to manage the other harms, whether those are economic, social or other health harms. We’ve seen from some of the polling, certainly even this week, that, I think, about three-quarters of people in Scotland are satisfied with the way that Nicola Sturgeon has handled the pandemic.

Fiona Bruce

[00:02:18] She is handling it better-than-Boris Johnson?

Kate Forbes

[00:02:24] I think it is one of the most challenging situations for any leader to be in. At the very beginning she said we’re going to make mistakes. She has been upfront right throughout with integrity and honesty that things have been challenging.

[0:01:29] Should we just abandon trips abroad?

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:33] Should we abandon trips abroad? Are you planning to go abroad, Sam?

Sam Winter

[0:01:37] No, personally I'm not. I'm quite happy being in our country. I've arranged a holiday but obviously local. No, this year I don't think I will personally go abroad. Maybe next year. I'd just like to see how things pan out for the rest of this year.

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:54] Okay. We should be banning trips abroad according to Labour, Nick.

[00:01:26] Thank you, Fiona. In light of UK-wide COVID cases remaining significantly high and deaths consistently averaging over 100 per day, should the governments reimpose more restrictions to prevent a winter wave?

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:43] Andrew, more restrictions, should the government impose them, given how infections are rising?

Andrew Bowie

[00:01:49] Well, thanks for the question. Obviously the rise of infections is something that is concerning the government. They continue to watch the data and continue to look at the trajectory on which we're headed.

[00:01:26] Thank you, Fiona. In light of UK-wide COVID cases remaining significantly high and deaths consistently averaging over 100 per day, should the governments reimpose more restrictions to prevent a winter wave?

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:43] Andrew, more restrictions, should the government impose them, given how infections are rising?

And let’s hear our first question tonight, which is from Charlie Shrimpton.



 



Charlie Shrimpton



[00:01:28] What does it tell us about the government’s priorities that they were forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford so that the poorest people in the country, and especially children, would be fed over the summer holidays?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:01:41] So, obviously, talking about the free school meal vouchers for children. James?



 



James Cleverly



[00:01:47] Well, coronavirus has meant that we have had to bring about an unprecedented range of support packages for individuals, for businesses, for the self-employed and indeed for families, and we...



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:02:00] Yes, but you weren’t going to do this until Marcus Rashford said.



 



James Cleverly



[00:02:03] And we had…we’d already supported families to help feed their children during the Easter break. And ultimately, we’re trying to get back to a more normal way of working. And we had hoped that we would not need to put this additional support package in place over the summer, but we do listen, the government did listen; and Marcus put forward a really compelling argument and we did listen and the government decided to extend the existing scheme into the summer holidays. I think it was the right thing to do. And ultimately, what we’re trying to do, as I say, is we’re trying to get back towards normality, because really that’s what everyone wants and that’s what we’re working towards.



 



Fiona Bruce

I think it was the right thing to do.

Charlie Shrimpton



[00:01:28] What does it tell us about the government’s priorities that they were forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford so that the poorest people in the country, and especially children, would be fed over the summer holidays?



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:01:41] So, obviously, talking about the free school meal vouchers for children. James?



 



James Cleverly



[00:01:47] Well, coronavirus has meant that we have had to bring about an unprecedented range of support packages for individuals, for businesses, for the self-employed and indeed for families, and we...



 



Fiona Bruce



[00:02:00] Yes, but you weren’t going to do this until Marcus Rashford said.

[0:01:46] I think they were trying to keep us safe. I don't think any one of us wants to be kept locked up but the reality is if we hadn't had the lockdown, many of us.wouldn't be here today, especially oldies like me. I think we have had to endure that, and we have to come out of this sooner rather than later, I totally agree because otherwise we are going to have a lot of unintended consequences, that's things that will be a lot worse than possibly, you know, some minor out breaks of the actual virus. So. It's important we come out now. It's important that we adopt the new normal, because, it is a new normal.

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:20] So let's start with our first question tonight, which is from Alison Goldie.

Alison Goldie

[0:01:26] Good evening, Fiona, good evening Panel. So given the success of track and trace we rely significantly on the public's trust and the Government and compliance with the rules. Does the Panel feel this has been undermined in any way by the events of this last week?

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:46] Gosh! It feels like we have done nothing else but talk about the events of the last week and of course Dominic Cummings. Ian Murray.

Ian Murray

[0:01:56] Well, thank you for the question, Alison. I think it gets tothe nub of how we get out of pandemic. The way we get out of that is test, track, trace and isolate. That's the only way without a vaccine we were going to be able to go forward. With the saga we have had last week, the Prime Minister and Government, his integrity is in tatters. We have seen it is one rule for the Prime Minister and his team and one rule for the public.

We have seen it is one rule for the Prime Minister and his team and one rule for the public.

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:20] So let's start with our first question tonight, which is from Alison Goldie.

Alison Goldie

[0:01:26] Good evening, Fiona, good evening Panel. So given the success of track and trace we rely significantly on the public's trust and the Government and compliance with the rules. Does the Panel feel this has been undermined in any way by the events of this last week?

Fiona Bruce

[0:01:46] Gosh! It feels like we have done nothing else but talk about the events of the last week and of course Dominic Cummings. Ian Murray.

Ian Murray

[0:01:56] Well, thank you for the question, Alison. I think it gets tothe nub of how we get out of pandemic. The way we get out of that is test, track, trace and isolate. That's the only way without a vaccine we were going to be able to go forward. With the saga we have had last week, the Prime Minister and Government, his integrity is in tatters. We have seen it is one rule for the Prime Minister and his team and one rule for the public.

AudienceMember 20210708QT01

[0:00:06] Thank you, Fiona. Welcome, Panel. Was Boris's nonaction against Matt Hancock yet another missed opportunity to show leadership and set the standard for social distancing?

David Davis

[0:00:20] I don't think so. With all these things, when somebody falls from grace, there's almost a lynch mob in the press. I watched this, I thought it was plain that Matt was going to go. But Boris, I think, made a number of decisions. I'm just reading his mind, the same way you would.
