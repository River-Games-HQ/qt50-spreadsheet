[00:02:46] That’s the question everyone is asking at the moment. It is fantastic news that we’ve got the vaccine. It really is a moment to be proud, to be proud of all the scientists across the world working on all these vaccines and to have that light at the end of tunnel, when you are putting up your Christmas decorations you can think there will be an end to this because the vaccine is coming. It is brilliant. We know, and the scientists have been clear in the press conference with the prime minister, this is going to be very challenging logistically. Firstly, how is it going to be delivered and to whom. Of course, there are tiers of people that are going to get it first. But I don’t know about you, but my MP WhatsApp groups have been buzzing all day with people saying we heard there’s going to be a hospital here doing it, a hospital there, but what about our area?

Everyone is worrying about that. We worry about care homes, of course we do, because we know that, you know, there are logistical issues with this vaccine in terms of the temperature it needs to be. Are we going to make sure we can get to those care homes properly. Then I think there’s a challenge with public health and making sure people know they can trust this vaccine and they should use it. We’re not measles-free in this country any more. We were. We’re not any more because people haven’t trusted the vaccine. So we need a really good public health message. But, you know, this is a really big challenge. The government haven’t got it right on things like test and trace. They have to get it right now because these are people’s lives on the line. We can’t get this wrong again.

[00:04:20] Vaccines mark a major advance in human achievement since the enlightenment into the 19th Century and Britain’s been at the forefront of those achievements over the years and decades. But this isn’t the time for vaccine nationalism. I agree we should congratulate all the scientists, those in Belgium, the States, British scientists working in international teams here in the UK, with AstraZeneca --
Fiona Bruce
[00:04:48] What about the logistical capabilities?
Liam Halligan
[00:04:52] They are obviously forefront now, now we’ve got a vaccine that’s been approved. It’s good -- I’m reassured that the British Army are going to be involved. They’re absolute world experts at rolling out things, complex logistic capabilities. This is probably going to be the biggest logistical exercise that our armed forces have undertaken since the Falklands War, which I’m old enough to remember, just about. So, as a neutral I’d like to see a lot of cross-party cooperation, and I’m encouraged with Sarah’s tone, everybody wants to see us getting on with it now. They don’t want to see competition on whose vaccine is best. There will be some instances where the Pfizer vaccine works better, another where you can’t have cold refrigeration, across the developing world as well, a cheaper vaccine like the AstraZeneca works better. Let’s keep our fingers crossed and hope we make a good job of this.

[00:05:54] What prompted you to ask this? Do you have concerns or what’s behind it? [Coleen]: Well, we haven’t really covered ourselves in glory so far at any logistical exercise. I mean with the PPE, test and trace, any of the things that have had to be done to do with Covid. So, yes, I have got concerns. I also think maybe the government should be managing expectations better. They seem to come out and say everything is going to be done by springtime. I think that’s highly unlikely given the record. I don’t know that a lot has been gained by suggesting that. It will be great if the military is involved. I think it will be much better if the military was involved in the command and control rather than just the delivery side. I hope that’s the case.

We have a plan, we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it together, but this isn’t going to happen overnight. We need to be realistic about that.

[00:07:34] Can I just ask you, the government and Jonathan Van-Tam have been saying today the aim is to get it to care homes first, but there are difficulties with this vaccine because it has to be stored at such a cold temperature so it’s not getting to care homes first.

[00:08:42] Peter, in terms of the logistics, a fantastic breakthrough to have a vaccine, never mind a couple coming down the pipeline. What about getting it out to people?
Peter Openshaw
[00:08:54] This is a tremendous triumph of science that we got this far. I think we are up to the logistic challenge and that’s because we have a system in the NHS that can deliver vaccines at scale. We have tremendous networks which are already present throughout the country. I don’t think we need to put in a whole new command and control system in order to do this because we do have the people already up for this particular challenge. I think the problem about breaking up the batches and getting them out into care homes is an important one. We know the best way to deliver vaccines is at the point where people are assembled in work places, schools, so on. We always know that’s the best way to do it. So I think we must find ways of getting around the logistical problems, which are because of having only four stages that you’re allowed by the regulations to stage this vaccine as it comes from the factory into the delivery points. But I think that is surmountable. It just needs a lot of work.

Tom Kerridge
[00:10:02] From my point of view it has been a magical couple of days, the news that’s coming through. It feels like there’s an end to this nightmare we have all been living. There’s short-term excitement about it, long term there are the problems of getting everybody vaccinated to make sure we can get our lives back to normal and running in that space. Yes, we have a poor track record how we’ve dealt with coronavirus. I have to be honest. You look at the way that the whole thing has been dealt with, you look at the track and trace system, it is something that we have struggled with. There have been bold claims about it and we’re still struggling with this now. So I can understand people’s worry, Colleen’s point of view are we going to fall into the same trap where it comes to rolling out the logistics of this. However, logistics isn’t falling into the tech problem where we’re trying to get everybody to download apps; it is more about getting close to people and resolving it. So, yes, I think if there are the army brought in, if there is people who are all over this have an understanding of how logistics work, it isn’t the same as the track and trace system, so it gives hope that perhaps there is something coming through the other side, that we will, eventually, get something right during this.[DONE]

[00:11:26] Lots of hands. Beth. [Beth]: It has been a difficult year for everybody and I think news of this vaccine is a huge encouragement, the end is in sight. Also it is a very quick vaccine in the fact it has to be stored at -70C, it can’t be kept in the fridge like most normal ones can. Who’s going to be receiving it first in care homes and other facilities that perhaps aren’t geared to catering for this type of refrigeration, that could be an additional logistical challenge. But I think noticing the fact we’ve managed to produce this vaccine, scientists and research managed to produce this vaccine in a matter of months is a remarkable feat. I think the logistical side of it will be realistically easy compared to developing the vaccine in the first place.

[00:03:28] Thank you. Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca insist there is no shortage of vaccines. There, instead, appears to be a huge blockage in our ability to deploy the vaccine effectively and appears to stem from a lack of joined up planning and a refusal to use all the resources available to us. If Israel can manage 16,000 vaccinations every day, why can’t we do better?

[00:04:02] Thank you very much for the question. So, the NHS in England and Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland have put together a delivery plan. We started on 8 December with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a vaccine that has to travel at minus 70 degrees Centigrade. We rolled out into primary care which is the most effective way to get to the most vulnerable, which we were focussing on which is the over 80s. We have now vaccinated 1 quarter, 25 percent of people who are over 80. In two weeks’ time they will have that protection when the vaccine begins to really take effect.

So with Pfizer/BioNTech we had to hold back 50 percent until the regulator, the MHRA and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the chief medical officers said we could go to a 12-week interval between doses instead of the three-week interval. Now, this week, as of Monday, we got 530,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, and we have millions of doses that will come in the next weeks and months to come. The target we have been set is to do the first four cohorts by middle of February. So stretching target, an ambitious target because you are talking about 13 plus million people who will be the vaccine.

They had all the logistic issues we have, but they managed to roll out a million vaccines in 12 days. The second point, you mentioned about the 12-week gap between the first and second dose for Pfizer. The World Health Organisation yesterday were very clear that they reckoned that -- well, they stated that it should be between 21 and 28 days maximum gap between the first and second dose and, in exceptional circumstances, up to 6 weeks. This is a really, really important point.

Nadhim Zahawi
[00:07:40] Of course. But the data release is tomorrow and then from next week every single day the prime minister wants to, every day, say the data of everybody we vaccinated.
Mark Walport
[00:07:54] Clearly we’re in a race between getting people vaccinated and the new more transmissible variant. The numbers speak for themselves. The reality is that the supply of vaccine is limited at the moment so we need the maximum amount of protection from the doses of the vaccine that we’ve got. So the reality is that the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech is about 70 percent protection, it is reckoned, and Pfizer -- sorry, the AstraZeneca one is 70 percent and Pfizer/BioNTech is about 90 percent. If you can give it to 2,000 people and get that protection, then it makes sense to prolong it for 12 weeks. So long as people get the second dose, then it isn’t critical whether you get it quickly or a bit later in terms of getting the secondary immune response. So this has been looked at very carefully. There’s no doubt it isn’t perfect, but the situation here is the perfect may be the enemy of the good and what we need to do is get the maximum protection for the maximum number of people. Under those circumstances, I think most people who are immunologists, who are vaccine experts, and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation have looked at the data, so not perfect but probably the right thing to do under the circumstances where the vaccine is limited.[DONE]

I’m sitting here tonight as someone who is completely unvaccinated. I am on COVID wards every day, working with COVID patients, I’m very frightened that I may bring the virus home.

There are paramedics, nurses, healthcare assistants, doctors, NHS and care workers in their thousands who every day are going into an environment in which the air is thick with COVID and we are completely unvaccinated. From our point of view it feels like, in the first wave in March and April, we were sent in with woefully inadequate PPE, again it may be an excuse, it may be a reality, but the government’s position on that was logistics, it’s not our fault, it’s a supply issue.

[00:11:34] Andrea. [Andrea]: I would like to ask what the opinion is. The BMJ stated that there were concerns from GPs back as far as middle of December with them having been told to expect the vaccine, make plans, arrange patient appointments, then the vaccines didn’t turn up.
Fiona Bruce
[00:11:54] PS, you’re a surgeon.
Audience Member
[00:12:02] Rachel is right. As frontline workers are exposed to this. She mentioned that 650 people, healthcare workers have died as a result of COVID but a lot of those healthcare workers are from the BME community and there has been no mention of the increased risk of COVID in the BME community with this vaccine roll-out. We’re not featured at all on the prioritisation schedules, and I really want to know why that is.

[00:12:30] Colette? [Colette]: My question is that, obviously, we’ve a lot of logistical issues. I’m very grateful to everybody who works in vaccines, my husband does. I think you do an amazing job. My question is we got quite a few issues and we can see what other bottlenecks are we going to hit. We have the problem of supply. What about vaccinating people and the concerns that GPs have and people signing up to become part of the vaccination programme and having to go through a lot of red tape to provide themselves to do the service?
Fiona Bruce
[00:13:08] Anneleise, a lot of concerns coming from our audience. It is worth pointing out, isn’t it, in terms of comparisons to the EU, the UK is doing well in terms of getting the vaccine out. [Speaker] We are. But this is a race against time, as Mark just sated. Ultimately it was in the UK that we saw the first licensing of this Pfeiffer vaccine. We had the Oxford vaccine developed in our country. We must be ambitious. That means saying that 2 million a week target has to be a starting point. We need to be moving forward much more quickly. We need to be open about where there are problems. I think Susan was actually saying there what many of us have heard that there have been logistical issues and government must be open about where they are. There’s a huge amount of goodwill. People want to help in this national effort to get as many people as possible vaccinated. But that means being open about where there are problems, where there are blockages, just like Colette said, where there are logistical issues with getting people signed up. I’ve had retired healthcare workers in my constituency saying they want to help but because of the administrative blockages they can’t get through. We had so many problems with test and trace. We can’t have a repeat of those issues now when we’re rolling out the vaccine.[DONE]

[00:14:40] I think Annaliese is right in terms of the progress that needs to happen now. It can’t be much of a surprise that we need to do a rapid vaccine roll-out. We’ve known about this for 9 months, at some time we were going to have to do this. It is a logistics and planning exercise. We heard before the show that good people are involved, but I think you’ll find, Nadhim, there is a willingness across the population and across businesses to do whatever you need, whatever is required to accelerate and deliver this vaccine. I’ve got 270 sites around the country of gyms, the size of 3 or 4 tennis courts, I have memorandum on if you are low the government are paying, we and I’m sure every business in our situation that have been battered, frankly, by this virus, our biggest interest collectively as a country is seeing us come through this as swiftly as possible. You guys tell us what you need, we’ll make what’s available to you, what’s necessary, do anything in our power to make that happen. But let’s accelerate the process and be truly ambitious. If we can do 1 million a week, why can’t we do 4 million a week. There’s enough people, enough goodwill in this country to make that happen. I’m confident of that. [DONE]

[00:16:02] The community pharmacy, there are 11,000 of them, have been saying today they typically do the flu jab vaccine, they know how to do it, they want to help with the coronavirus vaccine but they haven’t been able to. We spoke to a trade body before they came on air. They said the applications to do so have been closed since 6 December. They cannot help. Why won’t you let them help? Are you going to let the community pharmacies do the jobs? There’s 11,000 of them.
Nadhim Zahawi
[00:16:34] I hear you. If I can take you through the plan. It is important for everybody here, whether Annaliese in the Labour Party or the audience. So the plan is you’ve got hospital hubs, they have been operationalised, then the primary care networks. So 5 or 6 GPs in an area of 50,000 people come together, deciding who will lead, the others will support, then delivering really for work because they can reach the over 80s and they are going into the care homes because they are the most vulnerable people to this virus, the over 80s. Then the NHS frontline and social care, then we get to groups 3 and 4. Bear with me for a second. Beyond the primary care network, so 595 already vaccinating. By the end of the week that’s risen by 200. It will keep rising. Ultimately we get to about 1,500 sites because we are adding on national vaccination centres that will come online in details, and the community pharmacies which you talk about. 115 will come on line on the 11th of this month.

[0:11:24] On your point on Universal Credit which is meant to be helping people up the employment ladder, I guess what shocks me at the moment is the sort of speed of change with massive inflation across all sectors. The situation with energy which we don't own, which we should. We saw the closure of CF fertilisers, on the back of that no C02. The word for me that is missing out of the thinking and not taking anything away from Nadhim and the fantastic progress made with vaccination, I mean, incredible, and fantastic support in many ways for business, with furlough, bounce-back, hospitality grant loans, all of those other things. Now as we come out of it, we've got to tread slowly and carefully and make sure we don't leave anybody behind and these massively rising costs, you know, I think when we look at the wider aspect, 70 million people, you know, energy for 70 million people, food supply, the just-in-time way of working on food supply. We saw empty shelves. Everybody in this room would have experienced empty shelves. They couldn't buy what they wanted when they wanted. Those lessons seem to

have been forgotten from just 18 months ago. We cannot take energy for granted. We cannot take food supply for granted. They have to have a long-term approach and long-term investment and a will from government to work with business, and I guess what I felt on behalf of business at the moment, it doesn't feel like government really wants to work with business and this adversarial approach cannot carry on, it is exhausting, it is wearing. We know that lovely word ""partnership"" is the best way forward. It doesn't feel like partnership right now and a lot of people across the country will be wondering how, when they go into the winter months, how they make ends meet.

As we headed up to Manchester, Hassan, we are an extra half a billion for those families and individuals who will find it hard this winter because of their utility bills and because of the need for additional support for food, and that will go through their Local Government, through councils who know them and are probably best placed to help them. So all that is happening. Plus, of course, remember the introduction of the National Living Wage. That's put £4,000 a year in additional money in people's pay packets. So, all that support, plus, of course, remember we've got kick-start and that is another £2 billion in the scheme to get people back to work. And restart which is £2.9 billion.

Right, let's start with our first question which is from Daniel Greening.
Daniel Greening
[00:01:26] Will we be allowed to go on a holiday this year abroad?
Fiona Bruce
[00:01:30] Will we, Vaughan?
Vaughan Gething
[00:01:32] I think it's impossible to say is the honest truth, and that's part of the difficult that we still face now. For all the progress we've made, and it's the hard-won sacrifices that people of Wales has meant we're in a position where coronavirus rates are now under 40 in 100,000, we know that in other parts of the world where we would normally have holidays the rates are rising, so mainland Europe in particular there are real challenges there

Vaughan Gething
[00:01:55] We also know there are new variants that are likely to come from other parts of the world as well and they could be really damaging to us and actually adversely impact our of course very successful vaccination programme. So I'm not planning to go on a foreign holiday this year.
Fiona Bruce
[00:02:12] And presumably you're not going to be in a great rush if you've got Mark Drakeford saying that the idea that we will have international travel back as it was before in the middle of May fills me with horror, that's what he says. Does it fill you with horror?

Vaughan Gething
[00:02:26] Well, I had to make choices and I've had to make choices all through this crisis of course, and I made choices to change the rules on travel, on testing, while there were planes in the air coming back from Zante in particular, and that's because of the evidence that international travel was reimporting coronavirus into Wales when actually remember that last summer we had rates down as low as two in 100,000, so we saw coronavirus come into the UK largely because of the February half-term over a year ago, we saw rates increase again at the end of the summer, significantly because of international travel as well.

[00:03:00] So, you know, I think that international travel in the way that we were used to before, and frankly I'm one of those people who enjoyed going to different parts of the world, but I still think for the great majority of us that's going to be put off for some time to come because the risk of coronavirus being reintroduced with all the harm it's caused economically, in mental health as well as the physical health crisis, I think they're too great a risk. But we'll have to see what happens in this country and of course in the rest of the world.

[00:03:25] So it's not sounding fantastically likely for the summer, I think from that. Claire?
Claire Fox
[00:03:30] I think that we have to ask how we think the vaccine has worked. I mean, I think it's been a brilliant success, hasn't it? And consequently, we should be safe, we should be protected, we should be in a position where if we go on holiday, we're not going to reimport coronavirus, that's not the way it works. We have got a situation where fantastically we are now largely as a society not at the same risks because of the vaccine situation and consequently, I think to accept the draconian measure of a government, for example, banning you from leaving your own country is something that we should be very sceptical about.

Claire Fox
[00:04:00] I'm sure a lot of people will be frightened to travel but I do think that people should be able to weigh up risks. I also haven't liked a certain tone which is this idea that anyone who goes on holiday is just being selfish and indulgent and that somehow that's a degenerate thing to do when in fact people do need to exert their freedom at this point. There have been terrible stories and people need the opportunity to relax and I do think holidays are part of that.
So I'm hoping that I will get to be able to travel.

Vaughan Gething
[00:04:44] Claire is wrong about part of that because actually the reality is that we do know that there are other variants in other parts of the world that are a risk to us. That's why you can travel now but there are quarantine measures in place as well. So if you want to go and have a week in the sun, you've got to bank on the real prospect that you're going to spend ten days in quarantine when you come back, and for many families, that means that that isn't going to be a real option.

[00:05:04] Okay, let's see what our audience has got to say about it, Kuabina?
Kuabina
[00:05:08] Hi, I just think it's also important to think about the countries that we do travel to. Obviously as us Brits will have the vaccine, that doesn't stop us from transmitting it to other people, and if we do go out to holidays in places like Europe who don't have as many people vaccinated, we could also cause a knock-on effect to those countries. I think we need to be mindful of the effects that we have on those other countries as well, because as we've seen, the pandemic is a global issue, and if it's not fixed in one area, it will always come back to us, so I think that's something we should be mindful of as well.

[00:05:46] Hiya, basically, yes, so my example is that my mum moved to France last year and I've not been able to see her since then, and I think much as I completely get not going abroad, I do get it, I get the vaccine not being rolled out as much over there, it all makes sense genuinely, but I think it's like if there was a better way that it was handled when people were coming into the country initially, or even now, like, should we not have come up with some kind of better system by now a year in so that we know that when people are coming in, like…even like I've been to France sort of last summer and I came back and I got the train home from London and no one called me for ten days.

[0:01:10] We'll get underway with the first question.
Audience Member
[0:01:14] Hi. Why has it taken until 15 February for the government to impose quarantine at the border. Why haven't lessons been learned from Australia who closed their border in the first wave and now have low levels of infection?
Ian Murray
[0:01:34] It is a great question, a question we have been asking in Parliament for the last year. We're an island nation and most other island nations across the world did better than us because they took the decision early to stop incoming traffic. We had the South Africa strain for 50-odd days. It is only now we take the decision to close down the borders. It's too late. There was a study by Aberdeen University which showed most of the deaths happened because of the inward variants coming in to Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. It seems, again, where both governments have been too slow to react.

[0:02:10] The consequence of that is we're behind the curve. It is still not coming in until the 15th which means tens of thousands of people will be landing into the UK, potentially with new variants of COVID. It is too late. We welcome it, we wish it was every country, it is every country in Scotland, there are big issues about what to be done, how people can access -- how they can pay for them. I have two constituency members, one has gone to the Czech Republic, she doesn't know how she's going to pay for it.
Fiona Bruce
[0:02:42] Do you think the taxpayer should pay for it?
Ian Murray
[0:02:48] It is £1,750. There has to be some way of looking at the system you had before when you come out of this and saying why are we asking people to self-isolate then not checking when they were travelling. It has been a mess. There's a resolution here but it is too slow, too late and we are suffering the consequences of that.

Michael Forsyth
[0:03:12] The first thing is we didn't have the vaccine and we didn't have the new variants which the scientific advice is that we should be very concerned about. So that is why the borders are being closed. But we are in the ridiculous situation where, in England, the borders are closed to people coming from ""red"" countries, whereas in Scotland it is coming from all countries.
Fiona Bruce
[0:03:34] Where do you think it should be?
Michael Forsyth
[0:03:38] I don't think it should be either. We should concentrate on getting the vaccine done as quickly as possible.
Fiona Bruce
[0:03:46] But we should let anyone who wants to come in come in?
Michael Forsyth
[0:03:50] In Scotland no one is allowed from any country whatsoever and where the transport minister was suggesting we should continue with this until the rest of the world is vaccinated. By then we will have trashed our economy and destroyed our industries. We have to balance the economic interests along with the health risks. That's a difficult decision. I think all politicians from all parties should support the government in what it is trying to do.

Jeane Freeman
[0:05:16] It is a good question. I'm sorry, but, Michael, I think you're completely wrong. All the public health advice here in Scotland in the summer we brought cases down to virtually zero and the only reason they increased, primarily, was international travel. So we permitted the virus to re-enter the country. Now, people across the country here and across the UK are working really, really hard, putting up with restrictions on their everyday life, staying at home, that's a big message, not seeing friends and families, wearing face coverings, all of that. They're doing that because they want to reduce the level of the virus in their communities, in their country. I think it is government's obligation to then make sure that we take the steps to ensure that we don't bring the virus into the country. And I think the UK government has done something but not enough. It should be entirely all countries. We should say to people, I'm sorry, if you are travelling in, as we are saying in Scotland, if you are traveling in to Scotland then you need to quarantine in these hotels for 10 days, tested before you travel --

Jeane Freeman
[0:06:58] There's two things we will do. We'll keep on the discussions across the four nations with the UK government. I had one tonight just before I came here, to try and persuade them to not stick to just the red zones but, in the meantime, we also have to look at what we do about the land border precisely because of what the lady in the audience said. Most international travel into Scotland is routed through the big hubs around London, Manchester and elsewhere.
Fiona Bruce
[0:07:28] Have you got a plan?
Jeane Freeman
[0:07:30] What you can't have is people coming in, getting on public transport, coming up to Scotland and we don't know about that and they're not required to quarantine in a way that we can manage. So we have to consider what our options are about that land border. Now, I would rather that wasn't the case, to be honest. I would rather across the four nations we were take

[0:07:58] You haven't given an explanation why it has taken until mid-February to make the decisions. If what you said is true, and I have no reason to believe it is not true, that we imported the variants, why has it taken the Scottish government as well as the UK government to 15 February when it comes in to do anything about it?

[0:08:28] We are trying to reach an agreement across the four nations. We have taken the approach as others have from the outset, where we can get four-nation agreement -- where we are now is we can't be wait any longer for this. We've learned those lessons from the summer and we're saying now that we need to prevent international travel from any country into Scotland, and that means we do have to look at what our options are in the land border because the UK government won't go far enough.

Fiona Bruce
[0:09:04] Angela. Let's bring you in.
Angela Haggerty
[0:09:10] I think most governments have been too slow to act on the border issue. If you have been listening to the experts, the scientists they have been saying since the beginning of the pandemic there are clear strategies to follow to limit the impact it has. On a number of occasions the UK has not followed that advice, the border being one example. And we're now in a situation where we have vaccines. It is unprecedented, really, when you think back to the start of the pandemic, we were being told it would be a minimum of 18 months but probably longer, yet here we are less than a year and we are well into the vaccine roll-out programme. That's incredible. But what is vital now is that we try to prevent variants because that's the big threat to the vaccine strategy. The quickest way to get the economy back on track, to do all of these things is to get in control of the virus. So we're only talking about, hopefully, another matter of months before we should have our population as best vaccinated as we possibly can. It is too little too late, but we should be locking down as much as we have to, focussing on the vaccine roll-out, then we can think about moving forward after that.

My worry about this, though, is I tend to agree with the Scottish government's position, we should stop travel from everywhere, rather than just red zones, but my fear about this is it falls into the politicisation that we've seen a few times so it all becomes about borders, then it becomes about politics and about the constitution, and it doesn't become about public health. That should be at the forefront of everybody's minds and I would really urge politicians to make sure that they don't fall down that hole because that's really not what the public is looking for.

Stephen Fitzpatrick
[0:11:06] So, I have -- and I listened to the audience and I speak to my friends and I ask people about this topic. The thing I get more than anything else is the sense of fear that the public has now. I look back to where we were in March last year, what we were asked to do, the plan was to flatten the curve, protect the NHS, slowly but surely we have shifted this goalposts to what's expected. I have to say I understand why so many people have this sense of fear because of what they hear from the media, from politicians and so on. I also understand why people feel to strongly about the border issue.

Stephen Fitzpatrick
[0:11:48] I cannot understand for the life of me why 12 months ago this was not a policy we instituted straightaway. When I hear people talk about the policy today, what I hear is they don't understand why we didn't do this a year ago. But our politicians are not paid to peddle paranoia or feed on our fears, they are paid to lead. When I look at all of the news today, I see signs of hope everywhere. We have better therapeutics, we have falling cases, we have a better understanding of infection rates, we have 90 percent of the most vulnerable people in the country vaccinated. I ask what are people afraid of.
Fiona Bruce
[0:12:26] It is not quite that yet.
Stephen Fitzpatrick
[0:12:30] 90 percent of the over 70s have been vaccinated. 50 percent of the panellists in this room have been vaccinated. So when I think about what it is that politicians are trying to encourage, I say we weren't ready nor Covid-19, we weren't ready for lock down and we have to be ready for life after lock down. When I hear politicians talking about banning all inbound travel --
Fiona Bruce
[0:12:56] That's the question. Do you think that should have happen now?
Stephen Fitzpatrick
[0:13:00] I understand if a political leader says to me we have taken a wisk-based approach, these are 33 risky countries and we think this risk is worth protecting against. I think be it's a popular decision to ban all travel.

And what they begin to do is they educate, especially the younger generations, boys particularly, to understand and learn how to respect women. In doing that, they respect themselves. This is a five or ten year emergency situation, dedicated. Then I think we can begin to sort of see it level out.

We're the only part of the United Kingdom that don't. I think in 2021 not to have that is dispicable. Last year, the PSNI, it was over a third of crimes that were reported to the PSNI were for domestic abuse).

[0:10:54] Question: I think it is all well and good saying that this is not a problem with all men, which is correct, but I think that the real issue and the real difficulty for women is we don't know which men. And I think that's why a lot of people are -- especially women -- are more cautious.
Fiona Bruce
[0:11:16] If a Red Book? Question: I think as a society we need to make sure we respect and protect women, even from a male's perspective. These are our mothers, our wives, our daughters. Ultimately we have to provide an environment where women can flourish better without the shade of men.

[0:11:56] I have been struck today from women I've talked to or commenting on social media how widespread this sense of fear is and how many women have experienced abuse or harassment on the streets.
Fiona Bruce
[0:12:08] Were you surprised by that?
Steve Reed
[0:12:12] The extent of it, I was surprised by it. I think every woman has the right to feel safe walking around the street of this country any time whatsoever. What happened today and the fear that women feel is not the fault of women, it is the fault of men who have allowed women to feel this way.
Fiona Bruce
[0:12:30] What can be done about that? I remember going on Reclaim the Night marches when I was at university. They have been going since the '70s. What can be done about it?

[0:12:40] It is incumbent on men to reflect how we act. We have to call out attitudes abusive towards women when we see it. We have to become allies of women much more.

John Bercow
[0:00:10] No, it's an absurd act. Jingoistic sabre-rattling. If you tell me the despatch of those ships and the fact of election day today are unrelated, I can only say that you will believe anything. It is juvenile, it is downmarket, it is not constructive, it doesn't advance the cause of the arguments that need to be resolved. The truth of the matter is the problem flows, as so many things do, from Brexit. It isn't going to be addressed by a kind of Palmerstonian popularism. Frankly, Britain can do better than that.

[0:05:34] There was an agreement agreed at the last minute. In that Trade and Cooperation Agreement there were problems predictable and predicted. For a start, the protocol on Northern Ireland, that there would be a border down the Irish Sea was entirely predictable and predicted.

Hugh Osmond
[0:06:52] It is a failure of diplomacy on both sides. It should have been dealt with diplomatically. Who was to blame for sending ships where, it is very difficult to say. Clearly the French behaved badly, whether our response was proportionate, it is difficult to say. It should have been dealt with a long time before it got to the situation of sending out gun boats. There's higher priorities for the Royal Navy than floating around in Jersey. There's what's going on in the China Sea and around Russia. There's much higher priorities. It shouldn't have got to that.
Fiona Bruce
[0:07:32] The one thing for the French fishermen is people are at least now paying attention to them. I wonder if Scottish fishermen, who feel so betrayed by the Brexit deal, they might be wondering if they should be taking a leaf out of the French fisher folks' book.

[0:08:20] I was reading about this this morning. It seems to be that the fishermen from France are coming over because they are complaining they haven't got their licences. But they knew they had to get the licences in January. It is no different than we were being told on a regular basis make sure you have all your documentation sorted. I think there was an advert from the government on a daily basis citing that if you trade internationally, your deadline is January, blah, blah, blah. I don't see why the governments in France and Germany and all the others didn't do the same thing. They should have had their paperwork in in time. They obviously haven't. You know, therefore, they can't -- it is just typical French, if they are unhappy about anything they do a blockade for everything. It is just typical of their national -- of stamping their feet and usually getting things sorted. But, no, I think that the French were completely wrong. They were well out of order, and they need to get their own act sorted. They need to do the paperwork and, you know, they can't complain to anybody if they are late.

John Bercow
[0:10:32] I think there's an important point here. It isn't a question of people not filling in forms that they knew they had to complete. What is at stake is an argument about the behaviour of the Jersey authorities and, more particularly, the British government, in surreptitiously introducing new regulatory burdens and compliance requirements with minimal notice, of which the French fishermen couldn't have been aware.
Fiona Bruce
[0:11:04] Jersey disputes that.
John Bercow
[0:11:06] It is a violation of the principles and the intended application of the Trade Agreement. That's the first thing. In a sense of backhanded compliment to Robert, whom I served with in the House, it is remarkable through the deployment of his mellifluous tones he can talk about solving a problem when solving a problem means a betrayal of the British fishing industry and its decimation on the one hand, and, frankly, the denial of the rights, very long established over decades and more, of French fishermen.

Now we heard there are going to be vaccines before the end of the year but significantly less than we neat need. Hour many people need to be vaccinated for it to be successful.
MATT HANCOCK
[00:13:30] The honest truth to that question is we don’t yet know. It is one of the many things we don’t yet know about the vaccine. The reason for that is in the trials that the vaccines, you test for how effective they are protecting the individual, also how safe they are. If they are safe and effective we can start to roll them out. The early data from the Pfizer vaccine looks like it is 90 percent effective protecting individuals. [DONE] That’s great. So if -- if -- it passes the safety data, and that is a big hurdle it still hasn’t gone over, then we can start rolling it out and it starts protecting people as soon as they’ve -- a week or so after the second dose.

[00:14:28] That’s right. Because the evidence from the trial is how much it protects an individual. You can find out once a lot of people have taken it what the direct impact is on stopping the spread of the disease.

[00:14:40] This particular vaccine, Robin, we don’t know if it stops people catching coronavirus but we do know it stops 90 percent of them getting sick from it.
ROBIN SHATTOCK
[00:14:52] It’s really early. We know it prevents people developing disease for a period of time that it has been studied. We don’t know whether it will protect people for 6 months for 12 months.

MATT HANCOCK
[00:15:34] Yes, that is is our proposal. We have a committee that is made up of clinicians and experts that advises me as health secretary in my formal capacity, the joint committee on vaccines and immunisations. This group looks at the data from a vaccine, and they have been working closely with Pfizer and AstraZeneca, and work out what is the best clinical way of protecting most people. They put out an interim recollection, which is that first we should vaccinate people who are in care homes and the people who work looking after them, and then health and social care workers, then come essentially down the age range. For all the different things like obesity that we know has an impact on your vulnerability to Covid, we know age is the single biggest factor by a long stretch. So the answer to your question, yes, we will vaccinate according to clinical priority because that’s how we save the most lives.[DONE]

[00:17:02] I asked the question because I’m probably the oldest person here in the whole audience, but I would be one of those down the line to be affected. I would not be in the first tranche but I’m well over 70 now so I would be fairly close to that. I personally, I’ve heard quite a few people are concerned about having the vaccine, but I wouldn’t hesitate to have it because I know a lot of people are very scared at the moment. Simple as that.

[00:18:02] The priority is all about protecting people according to their risk from the virus. After we have gone down through the over 65s, according to the proposal, opposite the data that we’ve seen, and they may update it as we see more information, then you go to those who are particularly vulnerable from all age groups. After that, down to the over 50s. Once you get below the over 50s, there is less of a clinical justification for any particular ordering. [DONE]
ROSIE JONES
[00:18:46] What do you mean by below the over 50s?
MATT HANCOCK
[00:18:50] So for people who don’t have an illness which makes them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, who are aged between 18 and 50, they are the least likely to die from coronavirus so the clinicians who advise me on this expert panel say they come after all the people who are either older or work in health and social care or who have a particular vulnerability. Unfortunately, we know a lot about who is vulnerable to Covid because of having looked at who has been badly affected.

Then it arrives and you have to keep it at -70. We have known that for some time too so the NHS has been getting hold of the serious deep freeze. Then you have to distribute it. It will be a huge effort from the NHS. They are supported by the armed services in doing that. Thankfully, the NHS is a very, very significant organisation that reaches into all parts of the country.

We warned the prime minister about this which is why we voted against the withdrawal agreement. We said it was going to cause great difficulties. It arose because of a skewed understanding of the Belfast Agreement. What is really important to Northern Ireland is the trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, both ways. So it is important that we deal with all of the issues in the protocol.

At the moment we have a series of grace peers for food imports into Northern Ireland Northern Ireland. That ends on 1 April. It will get harder again, more delay at the borders. At the moment we are dealing with a period of much reduced trade and travel because of COVID.

It is clear that the British government didn’t prepare or work with businesses in terms of them being ready. I think that’s a big thing in terms of operational readiness being able to trade.[DONE] Obviously the deal went right down to the wire so there wasn’t time for businesses to prepare. When you look at what we are experiencing, it is a direct result of Brexit. I think it is nonsensical for some claims which I heard, particularly from Brandon where he said this is a direct result of COVID, when we all know it is because of the fact that there’s not a readiness on the British end in terms of being able to adjust to the new trading appearance. Now there has been some solutions found to a number of issues over the course of the last number of weeks, something I very much welcome. There have been tariffs on steel been imported into the north, obviously there’s a big manufacturing industry here that depends on that.

[00:08:06] More questions from the audience. Darren. [Darren]: What are the rules for pets going between Northern Ireland and Scotland or England or Wales? Because it seems to have become quite difficult.
Fiona Bruce
[00:08:20] I presume you have your dog behind you in mind? [Darren]: Yes.
Fiona Bruce
[00:08:28] A personal issue for you. Let’s come to the main question first of all. Are the food product shortages teething problems or deeper issues with the Irish Sea border customs protocol?
Brandon Lewis
[00:08:46] I think there’s a range of things going on. I think Michelle knows what she says is not quite correct. The point I made, and I made it clearly in the House of Commons yesterday to the Select Committee in and in oral questions, at the beginning of January there are a number of things happening at the same time. Businesses made commercial decisions before the deal was done, actually before the protocol agreement was made, which was a bit earlier in December. Before the deal was done. That’s a legitimate thing for them to do. They made those decisions. One of the supermarkets, that’s why you’ve seen different branded products. It seems they made a commercial decision on that. There was an issue with COVID. There was no doubt, not just in Northern Ireland but the Webber ministers have referred to this in Wales, even people in London have had an issue with the fact some food supplies have been affected by the problem we saw at Dover just before Christmas. That has an effect on what we have seen in food shelves. Businesses in Great Britain particularly getting used to the new systems. Now the reason the protocol is there is what it allows for is products moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, some of which move into the Republic of Ireland are due to have tariffs because they go into the EU from the UK.

[00:10:00] So that is as a result of Brexit. Nothing to do with COVID. Let’s be clear, that’s nothing to do with COVID.
Brandon Lewis
[00:10:08] I never said the problems are just because of COVID. It is just not because of the protocol. They are dealing with the new systems in place because we have left the EU. There are companies getting used to -- I think you mentioned John Lewis. There is no reason John Lewis can’t send parcels to Northern Ireland but the guidance came out on 31 December.[DONE]

Brandon Lewis
[00:10:38] There are a range of things happening at the same time. The point I made in the first few days of January, the judgment of the protocol and how it is working will be best made when we are a few weeks if not a couple of months down the line, and through COVID.

[00:10:54] You say a few weeks. We are three weeks in it. But in terms of the protocol and the differences it has made, the prime minister said in December there’s no question of there being checks on goods going Northern Ireland to Great Britain or Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Because if you look at what the deal is, we’re part of the same customs territory. No question of there being checks, yet, if you want to ship something like mince, for example, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you have to fill in an Entry Summary Declaration, a Simplified Frontier Declaration, a DVA mass goods reference, an export health certificate -- I could go on. There’s several other certificates here. If they are not checked, what are they?

[00:11:38] It is pretty simple. No question of there being checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. So he was wrong there. He’s not right, is he?
Brandon Lewis
[00:11:50] The the point we made Northern Ireland businesses will have unfettered access as part of the UK. That the protocol does deliver. From products move from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, particularly with SPS checks --
Fiona Bruce
[00:12:08] Sanitary and phytosanitary food, meat and animal products.
Brandon Lewis
[00:12:12] I’ll let you pronounce that bit. But also because we recognise and we have done for a long time the single epidemiological unit of the island of Ireland. There have been checks since the 19th century. That’s what we built on. We have built on that for those kind of products. Now this is partly to ensure that Northern Ireland businesses and Great Britain actions moving products to Northern Ireland staying in Northern Ireland get to do that tariff free. Obviously we have to make sure that they have that ability, unlike goods that may be moving to the Republic of Ireland where tariffs would apply.

[00:01:10] Our first question tonight is from Blair [Wondin 01:22].

 

Blair Wondin

[00:01:22] Hello. If the main Scottish elections return a full independence government, what moral and legal right does the Westminster government have to deny another independence referendum? 

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:32] Doug? 

 

Douglas Ross

[00:01:33] Well, I want to stop a pro-independence majority government, I want to stop the SNP having a majority at this election, as the Scottish Conservatives did five years ago. It was by people uniting behind the Scottish Conservatives that stopped that SNP majority in 2016, and people can do that again at this election.

Douglas Ross 

[00:01:50] And I think it’s so important because we’re still coming through the health pandemic, we’re still coming through the effects of COVID-19 that we’ve all been through and the restrictions for the last 12 months. And I really think we need a parliament that is focused only on our recovery, only on rebuilding after the last 12 months that we’ve all been through, rather than one distracted by another independence referendum.

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:02:10] And given that Boris Johnson has already said that he will not grant a second independence referendum that’s job done, isn’t it? Why does anybody need to vote for you?

./material/spreadsheets/cutiestestrun29april2021,20979,3,"
Douglas Ross

[00:02:17] Because Keith Brown, as deputy leader of the SNP, launched their 11-point plan for another independence referendum and said they would ignore Westminster; if they didn’t get a Section 30 order, which is the route that was taken in 2014, they would ignore that and hold a wild cat illegal referendum anyway. And that would bring uncertainty when we should be focused on our recovery, and I don’t want that uncertainty in Scotland over the next five years when our parliament has to be focused to protect people’s jobs, to support the NHS, to rebuild our educational standards. All of these things would play second fiddle to a nationalist government who are only interested in separation.

Fiona Bruce

[00:02:49] Do you want that uncertainty, Keith? 

 

Keith Brown

[00:02:51] I want that referendum; and the UK has no authority to prevent that referendum taking place if the people of Scotland vote for that, which was Blair’s question. And I should say on the issue of a wild cat referendum, the wild cat or renegade government in this country is the UK government. They’ve been taken to the Supreme Court, who struck down their decision to try and prorogue the UK parliament; they’ve signed international agreements with the EU which were immediately renounced afterwards; they’ve had ructions going on.

Fiona Bruce

[00:03:19] Yes, but they haven’t done anything wild cat about independence. 

 

Keith Brown

[00:03:21] Well, I think trying to stop parliament from meeting is pretty wild cat to me. And the simple fact is that the people who should decide if there’s a referendum are the people of Scotland. So, I don't think for a second Boris Johnson will continue to refuse to agree a Section 20 agreement. And it will be an agreement, we’re not pleading for that, we want to have that, it’s the best way to have the referendum. But he will not stand in the way of a referendum in Scotland if the people in Scotland vote for it.

Fiona Bruce

[00:03:43] Well, of course he says he will do exactly that. Let’s hear from some of our audience from Scotland – Nirana?

 

Nirana Unknown

[00:03:49] Shouldn’t the Scottish government, I want to ask Keith Brown, take the power focus…focus on power away from it and do welfare to Scottish population, which we need – education, health, industry, unemployment, all these problems are staring in our face. And that’s the reason that the Scottish government, now the SNP, that the people would like to…people don’t want to see another referendum. 

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:04:25] Okay, Nirana, thank you. Keith, do you want to answer that briefly before I move on?

Keith Brown

[00:04:27] Yeah, if I can. I think this is a really important question and it’s important because this is a really really important election, and I’ve stood in every single Scottish parliament election, this is easily the most important. So, you have two paths. One is if the UK is allowed to go ahead, for example, with the ability to sign trade deals which then start to undermine our NHS. If they default, as Douglas has already done, to tax cuts and austerity as their way to deal with the recovery, that’s not going to suit Scotland.

Keith Brown

[00:04:47] This is our chance to make our own decisions. And if you don’t exercise power over yourself, somebody else exercises power over you and they do it in their interest and not in your interest. That’s why we have to have the powers to have the right recovery for Scotland.

Fiona Bruce

[00:05:30] Okay. John?

 

John Unknown

[00:05:34] I was curious to ask Douglas Ross – Blair asked a fairly straightforward question and Douglas failed to answer it, as he does so many times, he just went off on a tangent about independence – why don’t you answer the question about if there’s a majority in parliament, isn’t that enough?

Fiona Bruce
[0:00:12] James Cleverly?
James Cleverly
[0:00:14] Thank you. There was a very clear imperative for the west, NATO, to initiate the action in Afghanistan. The attacks on the world trade centres were devastating, British people lost their lives of course, as well as the Americans, and Al-Qaeda was being harboured in Afghanistan, so the initial entry was to prevent Al-Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base of operations, and that initial mission was a success.
Fiona Bruce
[0:00:48] So why did we fail on the exit strategy? That is Rita's question.

James Cleverly
[0:01:14] To implement democracy, and that has proven to be a much, much harder proposition. The British position had always been that we wanted to have an exit based on certain criteria, certain conditions that had been met.
Fiona Bruce
[0:01:28] Do you think that has happened?
James Cleverly
[0:01:28] The American administration obviously felt they wanted to leave within a particular time frame, and we've now seen that there has been, both from the Trump administration and the Biden administration, a delivery on that American domestic, American decision, and we are now seeing the ripple effects from that. There is still work to do. We need to make sure that we embed the successes that we have had, and there have been some successes, and we also need to make sure that Afghanistan doesn't once again become the place where terrorist attacks happen.

[0:02:04] Rory?
Rory Stewart
[0:02:04] The reason why it failed is that it was reckless, shameful, essentially the entire Afghan air force was destroyed as we left, and the American forces left overnight. The big question is why were we pushing for the exit at all? In South Korea, the United States has been there for 70 years. They've got 25,000 troops there. If they had left after to help the years, they would have left at a time when South Korea had a GDP per capita lower than the Congo in a military dictatorship. If you are going to get involved, get involved patiently, and we had a Lightfoot print of 2,000 British and American soldiers that could have remained there with very few casualties at low cost. This was an unnecessary reckless defeat.

Fiona Bruce
[0:05:44] Rita, let me come to you.
Lisa Nandy
[0:05:50] I think first to acknowledge that the entry strategy was flawed as well. It was absolutely right, as James said, after the 9/11 attacks, for the UK to want to respect that Article 5 of the NATO Agreement had been invoked, that we have a duty to come to the mutual aid of NATO member states that British citizens have been some of the second biggest victims of the 9/11 attacks outside of the United States, and that there was a real need to degrade the capability of Al-Qaeda, but those decisions were flawed in that there was no real understanding of the complexity of what then had to come next, and so this has long and deep roots. There have been a series of political and strategic failures over a very long period of time that led to here. To answer your question ...
Nelufar Hedayat
[0:06:40] Both on the left and the right, that is really important to mention.
Lisa Nandy
[0:06:44] And both sides of the Atlantic, I accept that, and it's really important to have a level of humility about that.
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:50] What are Labour's failings in this issue?
Lisa Nandy
[0:06:54] The decision to go in in the first place was taken when George Bush was in power on one side of the Atlantic and Labour was in power on the other. There are lessons that we are going to have to learn about the last 20 years in Afghanistan. We should not shy away from learning those lessons about the role that my party played, just as we should not shy away from learning the lessons that James' party has played as well.

[0:07:12] To answer your question very directly, what we've seen unfold in the last few months was not inevitable, it was a consequence, as Rory said, by a decision of the United States to withdraw, which left the UK in a difficult position, and I acknowledge and respect that the decision by Joe Biden to put a firm end date of the withdrawal obviously to motivate the Taliban and give them a signal they could advance across the country. It had a huge impact on the morale of the Afghan forces as well and undermined the efforts that had been made to try to strengthen their resilience. If I could say this too: our government had 18 months to prepare - 18 months ago - in Doha, there was an agreement that the US would be leaving, and Joe Biden has always made clear that he would respect that agreement. To see these scenes at the airport, to see the Defence Secretary saying that now because of our failure to plan, people will be left behind, and they will die, this is unacceptable, and it is an unparalleled moment of shame for this government.

[0:08:26] Mehdi, let's hear the view from Washington.
Mehdi Hasan
[0:08:30] I think the answer to the question why was there no exit strategy is because we were lied to. I mean, we were lied to from the very beginning. We were always told that Afghanistan was the good war, and Iraq was the bad war. You know what? Afghanistan had its own share of lies. We were told there was no alternative to going to war, even though it was reported at the time that the Taliban were willing to hand over bin Laden to a third country if Bush offered proof. Bush said no. The Taliban in 2001 offered to surrender as long as their leaders were kept safe in Kandahar, Donald Rumsfeld no, unconditional surrender. How did that work out? For 20 years, Obama, Trump, Blair, Brown, Cameron, May, Johnson - all lied to us. 20 years with turning the corner, ""We're going to win, it's going well. Democracy's coming. The Taliban are on the run."" What do we get for 20 years? 457 UK dead, 2,488 American dead, 47 Afghan dead civilians, 69 Afghans and police officers. At what point do we say enough is enough? We have to end this, but it has to end. I don't accept for region nationality. South Korea, we've not been experiencing a 20-year armed insurgency. We cannot have endless war mongering. Doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results.

[0:00:48] The first question is from James alcock.
Audience Member A
[0:00:58] Why can you sit on a beverage on 8 March for a drink with a friend but you have to wait 35 days later to do it outside a licensed pub or restaurant? Social contact is no different. If anything, it's safer. Why are we waiting.
Fiona Bruce
[0:01:16] What's your feeling about this?
Audience Member B
[0:01:24] The social contact is no different. As much as I believe the British public want to do the right thing, the reality is, as an operator, I'll manage that for you, I'll make sure you're safe, that's what we do, we're experts in safety. If the guidelines are there to make sure people are 1.5, 2 metres apart, I'll do that for you. To make people manage that themselves, it is difficult.

[0:01:48] Ultimately I want parity in the rules and fairness. I don't mind if we wait until August, what I want is support and I want to understand there's some fairness, some parity. As an industry, I have to wait for Richi in that case to come out, now I have to wait for the budget. That's not fair. Ultimately we want fairness, parity, we want a clear message. I think Boris Johnson missed the chance to open the industry early, do it with that support, that safety and that thing that we'll do, we'll manage that outside for him. He's missed a trick.

[0:02:34] Everyone wants to get out, to be done with this thing, of course. But we know if you're not careful about the way you unlock you end up right back where you started despite having this phenomenal rollout of the vaccine with 7.8 million people having their first vaccines by today. We still have to be very cautious with it in order we can make this the final time. I would love for us to be able to say, right, that's it, caution to the wind, off we go, job done, but the truth is --
Fiona Bruce

[0:03:06] On the fairness point there's a big difference between something you can already do, which is go for exercise with one other person, now we're saying you can meet with them socially, again maintaining distance and what have you, but it's one other person, not a crowd, not a bunch of people.

[0:03:24] We have had to consult the scientists, ask for the chief medical officer's best advice, ask the experts from SAGE and a group who modelled all of this. It is not like it was all invented from nowhere. They showed us at each stage, if we do these things, this is what we would expect to happen from the response from the virus. I think the British people have been through so much, it has been such a long year, we do not want to blow it now. On 12 April, at the earliest, hopefully it will be then, we can get the outdoor hospitality going, including pubs and venues.
Fiona Bruce

Jeremy King
[0:04:06] I think the question is appropriate. We have no clarity. The frustration in the hospitality industry is we don't know where we stand. Just as we were talking about sitting on a park bench outside a pub, why is it I can order a coffee and go to a beauty salon on the 12 April, yet I can't order one in a restaurant on the 17 May? We've proven, the government has admitted, that we're safer than almost any environment.

Jeremy King
[0:04:38] The amount of diligence and care that the hospitality business put in to applying for both its customers and its staff is without doubt. So I feel that we're treated like children. We feel that we have got no understanding of what it is going to take for us to be fully open. And the arbitrary nature of this five-week gap, we're told it's about data not dates, but there's five-week gaps where suddenly we go from stringent conditions on 17 May through to all gloves off on 21 June. I don't understand. The country doesn't understand. It's illogical. It is irrational.
Fiona Bruce
[0:05:22] SAGE called for the five-week gap. We had a professor of public health on last week saying it was difficult to be precise as to whether restaurants, hospitality are quite as safe in terms of rising infections. It was difficult to be categorical about that, despite the efforts everyone is making.

[0:05:50] Tony, as head of the CBI do you agree with Jeremy and with James that it is going too slowly for the hospitality business, which has suffered so much already? .
Tony Danker
[0:06:06] There are sectors of the economy who are unhappy with the plan. I think the real regret is that you have to wait 10 days for the budget. The budget is part 2 of this plan. It is really important that if we're going to keep those sectors closed, for reasons I completely understand.
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:22] Do you think it is right to keep them closed so long as the government is suggesting?
Tony Danker
[0:06:26] I think the prime minister is the one person in the country who has to weigh up medical advice, school requirements, different sectors of the economy. I think it is only right if financial support comes along. By the way, James will know this, but only 40 percent of pubs have outdoor space. I spoke to a pub landlord in Cornwall today saying there's no way I could afford to open my pub so the outdoor is almost irrelevant.

Audience Member 3
[0:07:12] I would like to clarify something. I have beauty salons, we have both been treated incredibly disproportionately. You can't get a drink in a beauty salon. Secondly, I think we share the same frustration in business. We are chomping at the bit to get back into business. The reason for that is because there's absolutely inadequate government support. We have been secluded from grants. Many councils are not putting through grants for businesses. The permanent care sector has been secluded from VAT cuts. We have the issue where we are secluded from government aid. All James is looking for, quite rightly, business needs to give employees answers. We need to budget and plan. We are running out of cash fast and we don't want to hear from the government again of what their financial matters are or how many loans we can get.

[0:08:12] I think, apparently, we have the worst death rates per capita internationally yet our financial stimulus package, compared to other countries by GDPR is the third lowest. Quite frankly, it is time the government said what they would do at the beginning, which was we will do whatever it takes. If you are listening, whatever it takes, if you want business to open, you have to back business. We cannot save jobs unless you give us funding.
Audience Member 4
[0:08:50] I have my point would be that it sends the wrong message out. I really, you know, feel sorry for James and other like him. Actually, as a layperson that isn't in the industry, the message the government is sending out is that somehow it is less safe because that's why you have to wait longer. The problem, therefore, will be even when you do open, people will perhaps not be as willing to go to restaurants as they used to. So you need to actually realise it is about confidence, and the confidence you instill in the public. Your answer to Grant was not very good, if you don't mind me saying, because you didn't deal with the question.

[0:09:32] You muffled over it, talked about something completely different. None of us are saying we should throw caution to the wind, we just don't understand how one situation is unsafe, which seems to be just as safe as another situation, which actually might be more unsafe. So people won't follow rules or won't be inclined to follow rules if they don't make sense. You have to explain the science because it doesn't make sense to me as a doctor and as an academic from the University of Oxford. To me it doesn't make sense. You need to be able to explain it and you need to also instill confidence in the public that when you do open these sectors, that's the right time to open it and why you are delaying sectors in certain ways.

[0:10:16] Anneliese, Labour are supporting the government as far as the timing of the unlocking is concerned, despite the real things we are hearing. You think it is right to delay?

Fiona Bruce
[0:00:04] Lucy, we're talking about the Northern Ireland protocol.
Lucy Powell
[0:00:12] The issue is that the Northern Ireland protocol is a direct consequence of the type of Brexit that Boris Johnson and this government wanted to have. They didn't want to be part of the Customs Union or the single market or the other options and they don't want to align on food standards and veterinary standards which, if they were to align with the EU, which is what Biden is asking them to do, that would reduce many of the issues that we're seeing around the Northern Ireland protocol.

[0:01:00] They are subject to a lot of checks and the Prime Minister said that the Northern Ireland protocol was ingenious and would not result in checks or barriers or border, but that's what we are seeing and in effect there is a border down the Irish Sea.
Fiona Bruce
[0:01:16] What would you do differently?
Lucy Powell
[0:01:20] Well, what we are saying, which is what Biden is calling for, the British Government should align with the EU when it comes to food standards and veterinary services and that would get rid of most of the issues that we're seeing because the Government said they want high standards in food safety and so on, so there shouldn't be any problem for that.

Lucy Powell
[0:01:38] One of the reasons that the Tory Party were so against this issue of alignment was because they thought that would stop them getting a trade agreement with the US. Well, of course, now that we've got this change in administration, we are seeing a change in tone. The Government need to get on with it. They need flexibility and compromise because the EU can be absurd sometimes as well, but there is a way through this if the Government is prepared to take it.
Fiona Bruce
[0:02:04] Yanis, you have got an extensive experience of dealing with the EU. Is the EU having its sausages and eating it? Is the EU being difficult or the Government having signed up to something that it didn't understand?

Yanis Varoufakis
[0:02:20] London and Brussels are behaving like spoilt brats. Boris Johnson has to confess that the price of ending free movement of people is that he terminated the free movement of sausages between Britain and Northern Ireland. He has to acknowledge the impossible triangle as I call it. You cannot simultaneously have a regulatory divergence, no border within Ireland, and no border down the Irish Sea. You can have two of the three. You cannot have all three bodies. At the very same time, the European Union has been misbehaving, on the one hand yes, they have the legal right to inspect every great British banger that travels across the Irish Sea, but to do this, is an abuse of their legal right.

Yanis Varoufakis
[0:03:10] We have seen that already with the President of the European Commission trying to cover up her own vaccines procurement fiasco by banning exports to Northern Ireland. Maybe this is the sausage war or crisis we had to have so that some common sense prevails. Both sides have to accept that they have to work closely together so we might as well do this harmoniously.
Fiona Bruce
[0:03:36] Frank, what about Joe Biden's role in all this? After all, he is the American on the panel. He has come over here. There has been lots of briefing beforehand that he will try and bang heads together and get some kind of compromise?

Frank Luntz
[0:03:52] It bothers me because America has been too loud and too involved in too many things that it should leave to the UK and Europe. We had a president for 4 years. I mentioned to you that I was lucky enough to see Mr Trump just before he left office and I walked up to him and I asked him, ""What does the J in Donald J Trump stand for?"" You know what he told me? Genius. The US needs to remain quieter and let the UK and the EU sort it out.
Fiona Bruce
[0:04:32] Do you think Joe Biden should play a role in that?
Frank Luntz
[0:04:36] He should play a role in compromise and common sense, those are the roles that America should be doing going forward, but they should not be dictating policy. They need to speak less and listen more.
Fiona Bruce
[0:04:48] I know you're resident in the UK for many years. Show the audience your shoes that you put on this evening. You can just stick them out the side.

[0:05:12] Sausage wars, we heard Lord Frost saying we under estimated the effect of the protocol on goods movements to Northern Ireland, effectively saying the Government didn't understand what it had signed up to and it is having to deal with it.
Gillian Keegan
[0:05:34] To trade agreements are complex...
Fiona Bruce
[0:05:40] When you say it is the difference between what we say.
Gillian Keegan
[0:05:44] Let me get it out. They have the legal right to inspect every sausage. They probably have the legal right to open every packet and inspect every sausage. Is that reasonable? Is that necessary? So what happens when you put these things in place and sometimes they take a bit of time which is why we had this period to bed things in to get some of the practicalities out, but what happens is there is many things you have. You get trusted trade status. We know that sausage is staying in a supermarket in Northern Ireland and it is going to a frying pan in Northern Ireland. It is not going to the EU. You get sensible practical solutions. We have had the period of time which was supposed to iron out some of the technicalities, and what happened, they are using the legal right to basically make it impossible almost to get these goods on to the shelves in Irish supermarkets...

[0:06:40] This is not something you saw coming, not according to Lord Frost anyway?
Gillian Keegan
[0:06:46] You wouldn't expect there would be a harsh implementation that you wouldn't get things on to the shelves of supermarkets. They are concerned this is a back door into the single market. I understand that they want to keep the single market protected. We are talking about goods going from the EU to Northern Ireland. Get around the table, we haven't got time now. Time is short. Let's get some sensible approaches so we make it easier for these things to be exported and we all want the same thing in terms of the Belfast agreement, the settlement...

Kavita Oberoi
[0:07:34] What surprises me, you say we didn't understand what we were signing...
Gillian Keegan
[0:07:42] I didn't say that.
Kavita Oberoi
[0:07:44] Lord Frost... In business when we're two parties, we sign agreements and once we signed on the dotted line, that's gospel. Okay, that's gospel. If we didn't understand, we seek legal counsel at the time, and I think what is happening now, obviously the Northern Ireland protocol, I don't know the detail, it overrides the Belfast agreement and that's why we're having these issues and obviously it has to be worked through, but from a business perspective, you have to look at what you're getting into and we've got into that now.

[0:08:52] Once upon a time our word was our bond. We did it at the last minute, maybe there wasn't enough thinking. What other problems are we going to have from the Brexit agreement? If we sign an agreement we should stick to it. If we haven't done the homework to work out it is a sensible agreement, then we have to work things out. I am afraid this mess is very much about getting Brexit done as quickly as possible without thinking of ramifications.

[00:00:00] Our first question from Tim.
AudienceMember 20210610QT01
[0:00:04] Good evening. The government is committed to 1.4 billion for the schools catchup. Are the government waiting for Marcus Rashford to step in before they sort the rest of the funding out?
 
PETER KYLE :
[00:38:00] Kevin Collins was hired by the prime minister and he would have known the direction of travel. When he came back with the report, which was very, very obvious what it was going to report for quite a long time leading up to it, it's very in line with what all the other countries similar to Britain and our committees are calling for.

Suddenly Boris Johnson says no, Richi Sunac cuts the money. Now, for students, what I couldn't understand from all of this, last week I met a parent of a kid who, with his friends, jumped over the fence of his school so that they could get into school and do some activity over the weekend and use the facilities that they have. What does that say about Britain right now? We have students who are breaking into school because they want to be in school so much and the barrier is the government stopping them. We don't have a government which is matching the wishes that young people have for themselves right now. We have a government that has a catch phrase about levelling up. If levelling up is not about students and education. If levelling up is not about investing our people, then what is it for?

[JENNI MURRAY] : I have to say I was somewhat baffled when a real expert in education, Kevin Collins, was asked to be the author to show how we could get this serious situation up and running again. He came up with what I presume was a terrific plan because he really knew what he was talking about, needed £15 billion, a lot of money, admittedly, but it was a long-term plan for kids who really, really need help. You know, there are going to be young people leaving school very shortly who have had hardly any education for their final years, which is really worrying.

[LUCY FRAZER] : What that money is going towards is one-to-one tuition. So 100 million hours of one to one tuition which the evidence says will really ensure that they catch up, is going to support teachers and giving temperatures additional training, going to early years. Those are all things that Kevin Collins set out and said we ought to do.

[LUCY FRAZER] :
We also -- it's quite a controversial measure. We have to ensure the unions are behind it, parents are behind it, students are behind it. If they are, and if we do get that evidence, the Department of Education is reviewing that, reviewing it at the moment in time for the spending review, and the prime minister has clearly said that is not the end of the money. So we may very well be open to spending that additional money, levelling up, as Jenni said, which is absolutely important, and giving children the point they need.

[0:10:50] Yes, it has returned, on steroids, I'm afraid. It really has been shocking to see the way in which Owen Paterson has been defended by the Prime Minister that, in a sense, we've abolished any kind of independent system of dealing with MPs' misconduct and instead we have the prospects of a new committee that was going to be a kangaroo court. There was going to be a built-in government majority on the new committee.

[0:12:52] It's not. We have a situation here where we have to look at the process. I think if you look at the process that Owen Paterson went through, if that came to me as a constituency MP with someone in a different set of circumstances, when he was talking about the fact that it was 17 months, he had 17 witnesses, none of whom were questioned, I would want to be able to test that. I would want to have maybe a second structure, an appeal system. We also have -- we actually have two processes. We all have an independent complaints and grievance scheme that was set up with other issues around bullying, when the previous speaker was accused of bullying. That has an appeal system. This one doesn't.

[0:14:10] There is an appeal process. Let me touch on that for a minute. What happens is if a complaint has been made against you, let's say you received half a million pounds for two companies to lobby for them, let's say, as happened with this case, and he goes before an independent commissioner, he then can go before a panel of MPs then can go before the whole of Parliament. It is important to stick to the truth. What happened 25 years ago, obviously, was at the end of a long time of tory government conservatory MPs were taking money in brown envelopes to ask questions on behalf of companies, at the end of this long period of a conservative government we havetory MPs taking money again to ask questions and lobby on behalf. At least last time they were ashamed. It is not just conservatives, there have been other MPs, clearly, who have brought Parliament into disrepute and we need to have an independent system that can assess what has happened and make sure proper decisions are made. We cannot have MPs deciding for themselves.

That isn't the way we do things in this country. We need to have an independent panel and we have to be very careful that, once all the fuss is gone, they don't try to introduce some skewed system that will allow them to do what they like because they are not above the law. They are not above the law and they should make sure they stick to the rules like everyone else. You cannot, if you are found to have broken the rules, simply decide that you're going to change them.

Not just for the reasons being given because the process was so long, so opaque and somewhat contradictory. Not just because the lobbying he was supposed to have done is raising genuine public health questions with ministers, one was related to absence in --

[0:16:20] I think, actually, it is a bit disingenuous to say he didn't have the right of appeal. He was able to take his lawyers in to speak to the committee. He had 17 written witnesses that he could stake --

Fiona Bruce
[0:16:36] Written statements you mean.

AudienceMember 20211111QT03
[0:16:38] Written statements that that he could take. They were about character. I read the report yesterday. They were character references. It is like having more witnesses who will say, yes, he might be a burglar but while he was burgling your house he fed the cat. He's a nice man therefore it doesn't count. That's not true. I think the British public are fed up thinking Boris Johnson thinks he can get his mates after. My narrative for this story is that Boris Johnson flew in a private jet down to London, we object to a party, went to meet his friends. Amongst his friends were people there who persuaded him to get him off, to get Owen Paterson off. He said ""I'll do this"". It might not be the true but that's what it is in the general public's mind. I'm telling you lots of people are saying that. My friends are saying that. We don't understand what happened yesterday. At one point he was saying we should do this, by lunchtime today, everything is thrown up in the air and everything is changed. What's the truth of it? Where are the facts in this?

Fiona Bruce
[0:00:10] You have asked the question what do you think?
AudienceMember 20210916QT01
[0:00:12] I think it's a real scandal. I think it's probably the tip of a very large iceberg, and I think he could clearly issue up very quickly if he chose to be transparent and honest, and the fact he is not being suggests he is concealing something more. It's a real shame. It attacks the democratic process. Voters can only vote confidently if they feel certain they are getting honest and reliable information. Jon?

Jon Ashworth
[0:00:40] I totally agree with Alex. It is a scandal! The reason why these questions are continuing to circulate is because Boris Johnson has failed to provide a full and Frank explanation as to who paid for the lavish upgrade of his Downing Street flat.
Fiona Bruce
[0:00:56] Of course he says that he has paid for it. The question is who paid for it initially?
Jon Ashworth
[0:01:04] Indeed, indeed. This matters. It matters I believe for two reasons. First it matters in its own right, because we as politicians should be held to higher standards, and we should stand for principles of honesty, and integrity, and it's not good enough to say, oh this is just typical Boris Johnson, we know he lies, we know he plays fast and loose, it's just the way he is. That isn't good enough.

Jon Ashworth
[0:01:28] If we think it is we are really descending as a society. But the second reason why it matters is because somebody did pay initially for this. Somebody either put a donation through Tory Party head office, or loaned the money to Boris Johnson, and when Boris Johnson is the most powerful politician in the land, we need to know who is potentially buying influence! We need to know who he is beholden to. We need to know when he received this loan, when he paid it back, why he didn't declare it.

[0:02:02] It's not good enough just to say, well he has paid for it and the taxpayer didn't, if this donor is winning contracts from the Government, if this donor is winning taxpayer contracts like we have seen with donors over PPE, and ultimately, we are all paying for it because they are getting something back. It cannot be one rule for Boris Johnson, and something for the rest of us, we do need everything out in the open now because otherwise, this scandal won't go away.

[0:02:40] I disagree with that. I think it is an opportunity to make this shift and the Prime Minister was very clear yesterday at Prime Minister's questions that he has paid for those costs for the upgrade of his flat.

[0:03:08] I haven't had a personal discussion with him on this I haven't seen him. He has been clear he has paid for it. What's important is here somebody said there's so many different ways ministers are held to account. There are in a number of ways and rightly so the systems exist to make sure that as Jon says that we live to the standard that our voters expect, and the Electoral Commission has decided to look at the Conservative Party's finances and that's fine and how it should be. The Prime Minister has been clear he will indeed if there's a requirement to provide any documentation that's required. He has also don't clear...

[0:04:20] It's the -- we are saying he said he has paid for it, but again like you have said, he hasn't said who initially paid for it. Did he always intend to pay for it, that's the thing. Was this -- he saw as a way of cash for access as we have seen with Cameron? And lobbying, we have had that very recently. There's no, there hasn't been a clear answer. Can you say that there has because he said he has covered the cost, but when he covered that cost, and did he actually anticipate covering that cost when the money was originally spent. I don't think that's been answered at all.

Tim Stanley
[0:06:56] Presumably because the answer is embarrassing that's the only reason why they don't give it. I don't know why they don't give it. Everyone has assumed that there's something underneath the iceberg. I'm not sure there, and it's worth bearing in mind that lots of politicians have charged the taxpayer to redecorate residences in this instance the Prime Minister has paid for it himself. It's also worth bearing in mind that the original blind trust idea he is reported to have come up with is how parts of the US presidency is financed at the White House, it's not internationally ununusual at all. The thing with Boris Johnson is people voted for him knowing he doesn't do things the normal way. He is an unusual character. But they wanted that! They wanted someone who cut through what they regarded as a stagnant, frozen political system to get things done. What Boris Johnson will be saying in the run-up to the all-important Hartlepool by-election is I got us out of the EU and I rolled out a world-leading vaccine programme.

Think back to when we were run by someone who dotted all the i's and dotted the ts and did everything to the letter, Theresa May, her Government was a disaster. So lots of voters are going to judge whatever has happened and it's purely speculative, they voted for Boris Johnson to get certain things done, he has been getting them done, and they don't really care how he pays for the wallpaper.

At the end of the day, you know, everybody needs to be accountable. Everybody needs to be transparent. We expect a certain amount of moral standing with politicians in one sense, but in another, we don't. It's a strange situation because we know that there are back-handers going on. We know there's all sorts of different aspects to politics which as a person you know, a UK citizen, I'm fully aware, and I'm not aware of all the backhanders that go on, and all the inside conversations.

So, let’s start with our first question tonight, from our virtual audience, Tessa Marshall? 

Female Aud 1

[00:01:25] Okay.  So, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, will the panel commit to educating the citizens of the UK about the atrocities of the British Empire, take down the statues and the portraits that represent slave traders in the UK, and people who profited from Empire really.  And will you apologise for paying off the owners of slaves that the British people were paying off until as late as 2015? 

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:58] Robert? 

 

Robert Buckland

[00:01:50] Well, I think we’ve got to confront our history warts and all, and whilst there are many things we can be proud about with regard to Britain and its history, there’s a lot that we need to confront and be honest about, that is bad about our history.  But, I think that applying today’s standards to what may have happened many hundreds of years ago, is a difficult concept, to say the least.  And I think rather than using the language of blame and apology, we should be being honest about it, being forthright about it, using democratic processes wherever possible to deal with it.  So, let’s take for example, particular statues to slave traders, that might be in Bristol or elsewhere, use the democratic process to, through a proper decision, decide what to do with that particular memorial or statue…

Fiona Bruce

[00:02:52] So, do you think the people were wrong to tear it down then? 

 

Robert Buckland

[00:02:55] I think they were.  I think that, whilst I absolutely get and understand the huge strength of feeling that’s been engendered as a result of that appalling incident in Minneapolis, and the fact that many people have just had enough, and I get that utterly, I do think that we all owe it to each other to respect the rule of law, and to within that, work for greater equality.  And I think the scenes that we saw in Bristol were disturbing, in the sense that there didn’t seem to be that sense of order…

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:03:27] You’re Justice Secretary, do you want to see those people prosecuted? 

 

Robert Buckland

[00:03:30] Well I think an investigation is ongoing, and we’ve got to let the police do their job, independently, and let the prosecuting authorities follow the evidence wherever it leads.

But, the point I’m making is that if we stand for something together and collectively in this great country, it’s got to be the rule of law, and those values of freedom that attracted so many people here in the first place, and make this country, whilst it is imperfect, and whilst there is a huge amount for us to do, a good place to live, because we have that underpinning of the rule of law and democracy.  Let’s celebrate that, but let’s be honest and confront the past as well.

Fiona Bruce

[00:04:11] And let me just…Tessa, when you said that you want the government to apologise for reparations paid to countries until 2015, for slavery, what are you referring to? 

 

Female Aud 1

[00:04:20] So yeah, so the debts that we were paying off, refers to the 20 million pounds that was paid off to slave owners, when slavery became illegal in 1837, and so that debt is something that the British Government was paying off until as late as 2015. 

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:04:41] Robert?

 

Robert Buckland

[00:04:42] Well, look I think the history of our islands is always with us. 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:04:46] But, were we paying off that debt until 2015? 

 

Robert Buckland     

[00:04:47] I think actually, the lady is right, because I’ve read reports similarly about that… 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:04:52] That seems extraordinary. 

 

Robert Buckland     

[00:04:54] But I think she makes a very powerful point about the fact that you cannot escape history, and I think it would be fundamentally dishonest of us to, through removing statues and airbrushing out history, to then pretend that all was well.  Do you know, totalitarian regimes do that?  And communist regimes and other extreme regimes do that sort of thing, and then pretend that all is well, no we need to be honest, face up to it, and accept the fact that we are as much prisoners of our history, as anything else, but we have a chance through democracy, to break free, and progress.

Fiona Bruce 

[00:05:30] Bernadine? 

 

Bernadine Evaristo 

[00:05:32] Yes.  I totally disagree with you actually.  Because I absolutely relish that statue being toppled in Bristol.  They had tried for decades to either get the statue removed, or to get a plaque put on the statue, to provide the context for Colston’s history as a slave trader.  And I think everybody now knows that he was culpable in terms of some 80,000 Africans being enslaves in the New World, and 20,000 of those Africans were also lost at sea. 

So, I think he was a really toxic symbol in Bristol, and it was really important that he should go, or at least be contextualised.  And people tried to do that, and they tried for decades.  They didn’t get anywhere with it.  So, it felt to me that it was totally right that they should topple that statue, because of what he represented, and I am totally for a lot of the other statues in this country, being removed, and perhaps recontextualised in museums, or somewhere where we actually  understand what role they played in society in a wider sense, and the whole idea about… 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:06:44] And which kind of statues for example, Bernadine? 

 

Bernadine Evaristo 

[00:06:46] So, there was somebody removed from outside The Museum of London, for example.  

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:06:49] Yes, Robert Milligan who’s a slave trader.

./material/spreadsheets/cutietestrun18June2020,18468,5,"
Bernadine Evaristo 

[00:06:51] There’s also an argument, isn’t there, about Lord Nelson, you know?  Who is such a sort of totemic figure, literally, in this country. 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:06:57] And would you want to see his statue come off Nelson’s Column? 

 

Bernadine Evaristo 

[00:06:59] Well, I think we need to have that conversation, probably.  But, there is also this argument that’s come up, in terms of the statues, that we can’t change history and that it is the history of this country.  But actually, history is a construction.  Okay, events happen, we have a past, and then historians contextualise that past and interrogate it.  And what’s happened in this country, is that historically that has been done by elite white men, who have been the historians, who have set the framework for the events of the past.  So, history is something that needs to be challenged, and re-interrogated, and revised constantly. 

And removing those statues, in a sense it’s giving power to the people who really do object to a symbol of their historical slavery and all their allies as well.  The other thing about history, is that history has always excluded primarily women and people of colour, and working class people and LGBTQ+ people, in the ways in which it’s been told.  And that also goes to what you were saying about the colonial history.

./material/spreadsheets/cutietestrun18June2020,18455,6,"
Bernadine Evaristo 

You know, a lot of people in this country don’t understand the colonial history, or they understand it through a certain prism, where they feel that Britain went and travelled all over the world, in order to help people.  You know, there is still a section of society who don’t think slavery was a really bad thing.

So, I think it’s really important that we interrogate history and when you have to take the law into your hands and remove a statue, I mean, God, nobody died, you know, it’s just this little tin statue, whatever it was, that was thrown into the river, and it then led to this conversation that we’re having now, about the rest of the relics of Britain’s murky past, then I think it’s really important. 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:08:49] And when Tessa talks about removing statues or portraits of anyone who has profited from Empire?  I’m sort of wondering where does that… 

 

Bernadine Evaristo 

[00:08:59] Well…that’s the country, that’s the country isn’t it? 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:09:01] Yes, exactly. 

 

Bernadine Evaristo 

[00:09:02] But I think the visual symbols, the statues are really toxic, and they really are an affront to our shared humanity, and I think at least we need to look at that.  And, do you know, Britain was built on the wealth of slavery and colonialism, that’s the truth.  And we don’t really admit that.

Fiona Bruce 

[00:09:21] Rocco? 

 

Rocco Forte 

[00:09:24] Well, there’s a quote of Nelson Mandela that says, ‘Hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment.  We have to understand our history and we have to confront it.’  And I agree very much with what Robert Buckland was saying that we can’t judge the past by the values of today.  And it seems that people are trying to use the evil of slavery to re-write the history of this country, and try and negate the heritage that this country has.  

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:10:04] So, do you think it was wrong to take down the statue of Edward Colston? 

 

Rocco Forte 

[00:10:06] Yes, I think it’s wrong to take it down in that way, and I think any vandalism of any kind is completely unacceptable.  It’s against the law, and it’s disgraceful that the police were not there in sufficient numbers to prevent that happening.  

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:10:24] I mean, people have made comparisons… 

 

Rocco Forte 

[00:10:25] The worst aspect for me, of the London demonstration was seeing police running away from demonstrators in fear.  That’s a breakdown of law and order, and it’s mob rule.  And it’s completely unacceptable.

Fiona Bruce 

[00:10:43] And when you talk about vandalism for example, I mean one example that’s been quoted, and I’m not equating the two, but The Berlin Wall, for example, which obviously people just pulled down themselves, and the police stood by and just let it happen, but that’s…I’m not trying to say the two are the same, but nonetheless it was… 

 

Rocco Forte 

[00:11:01] The two things aren’t in anyway comparable. 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:11:03] Well, no, but the argument that is made that it was something that people took upon themselves to do… 

 

Rocco Forte 

[00:11:05] It’s amazing that we are obsessing about statues of long forgotten people at a time when the country’s sleep-walking to economic disaster, and our children are being prevented from going to school. 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:11:17] Well, we may well come to that Rocco, we’ll deal with one thing at a time. 

 

Rocco Forte 

[00:11:20] No, it’s mind-boggling.

Fiona Bruce 

[00:11:23] Okay, well let’s talk to some of our virtual audience that’s got their hands up, [Sim 00:11:28]? 

 

Male Aud 1

[00:11:29] I think it’s important that as a society, we look at the past, but we don’t need to glorify or celebrate the events of the past that we as a nation took part in.  I agree that statues that have links to the past, that bear issues relating to slavery, do need to be taken down.  I’m not asking for them to be hidden, I think they need to be in a museum, because museums are great places to educate and help remember the past.  Maybe even have history about British colonialism or minority ethnic communities in the curriculum, I think that would be an important step that we could take as a society? 

 

 

Fiona Bruce 

[00:12:17] [Fion 00:12:17]?          

 

Female Aud 2

[00:12:19] I was just going to say, I agree completely with what Bernadine Evaristo said about the fact that in Bristol…  I went to university and Bristol, and for years, you know, it has been a topic of discussion, to take it down and, you know, the voice of the whole democratic thing, they were saying people have been asking to take that down, and people have been ignoring it.  So, in some ways, somebody’s been saying, well not, actually, it needs to stay up there.  So, who were they trying to protect there?  They’re trying to protect the name of, you know, they’re trying to show that their statue should stay, and you say that it’s disturbing the way it was taken down.

We went into this pandemic with our foundations very, very weakened, huge strain on our public services before COVID even hit, huge lengthening waiting lists in the NHS, A&E overcrowded and a crisis of social care, and many, many parts of the country that had seen economic decline and austerity for some time.

[00:02:16] In Greater Manchester, where Andy Burnham was winning in very different places like Manchester and Wigan, where I've been elected four times in the last decade, if you look at parts of the country like Wales where Mark Drakeford is delivering for those communities the most successful UK vaccine rollout in the whole of the United Kingdom, if you look at Bristol where Marvin Rees is delivering clean energy, better buses and a living wage, I think our job is not to do navel gazing, no more pamphlets, no more self-introspection, our job is to go out and show people that we can deliver for the people of this country.

Lisa Nandy
[00:02:40] And why does it matter? I'll tell you why, because when I look at this government, what I see is a decade of broken promises. They've stripped money out of our communities while telling them they're going to level them up, they say they'll invest in our people and then they cut nurses' pay. They say they'll fix social care and then we have a Queen's speech where they failed to do it. It is not good enough. When it comes to the crunch, when they are asked to make big major decisions they are not on the side of the those communities.

[00:03:00] And that's why we've got to stop the introspection in the Labour Party, we can win, we are winning in parts of Britain, and we're going to go out and fight for the future of this country.

Michelle Dewberry
[00:03:24] Well, I think Chris is…her question is very key. The Labour Party, I think they are in the midst of a serious identity crisis at this moment in time. Everybody probably by now will have read Tony Blair's piece and have opinions on it where he said the Labour Party almost needs to be deconstructed and reconstructed. I completely agree.

Michelle Dewberry
[00:03:45] I think at the moment you, the Labour Party to me, feel more concerned about identity politics than they do about representing what used to be their base, which was the traditional working classes. Even one of your own MPs said that there's more talk about should we be pulling the Churchill statue down as opposed to building up…
Lisa Nandy
[00:04:07] From the Prime Minister, not from the Labour Party.
Michelle Dewberry
[00:04:08] …the working classes people. Pardon?
Lisa Nandy
[00:04:11] From the Prime Minister, not from the Labour Party. I can tell you, nobody in my constituency in Wigan was talking about it. They couldn't understand at all why the Prime Minister was obsessed by it. And let me say this to you, Michelle, as well. I've been elected four times in the last decade by working class people in Wigan. How many times have you been elected at all?

Michelle Dewberry
[00:04:26] I have not been elected once, but I tell you what, if it wasn't for people like me, the Brexit Party at the last election, there would have been way fewer Labour MPs than there are now. And this is one of the problems. In 40 years Labour have won, I think, three elections. And if you continue as you are now, in my view, you will be unelectable for a very long time to come.
Lisa Nandy
[00:04:50] But what do you actually want us to do? Because I've heard lots of talk about deconstruction, but very little, particularly from the Brexit Party, about how you solve some of the problems for people in this country.
Michelle Dewberry
[00:04:59] Well, first things first.
Lisa Nandy
[00:05:00] People need good jobs in this country, they don't need more division, which is all the party that you stood for was offering.

Michelle Dewberry
[00:05:05] Yes, so let's just be clear, by the way, because I know Paul's itching to get in as well, so I don't represent the Brexit Party. I ran firstly as an independent and then I ran secondly as a Brexit Party candidate. I'm not involved with that party, which is now Reform, so I'm not sitting here, absolutely not, as a representative of any political party at all. And Paul will come in now, but in answer to your question, what do I want you to do, well, I want you to decide who it is that you represent. I would like you to move more back towards the centre, stop with all of these bizarre identity politics, which turn people off…
Lisa Nandy
[00:05:37] That's not us.
Michelle Dewberry
[00:05:38] And very briefly before…because I know Paul wants to come in, there was a cartoon, I think it was in Private Eye, and the cartoon depicts a Labour councillor knocking on the door saying something along the lines of why won't you xenophobes vote for us any more in Labour, and this is the point. You see a lot of Brexiteers as racist, xenophobic…

Michelle Dewberry
[00:06:05] I can see him, he's itching.
Paul Mason
[00:06:08] Yes, I…to answer the original question, the point of the Labour Party is to take all the hope, all the aspiration, all the determination and pride of working-class communities and turn that into a programme of government that brings things for them. Because let's face it, what they're up against, they're up against extremely powerful people with a private education, with inherited money, for whom life will always get better, but the system we're in makes life often worse generation after generation for working-class people.
Fiona Bruce
[00:06:43] And so why do you think Labour has not appealed to them, in the numbers that you'd like to see?
Paul Mason
[00:06:46] Hold on a minute, I live in a working-class Labour heartland. It's called south London. The only contest where I come from is between the Labour and the Greens. And the people who vote for them are not kind of oatmeal latte sipping kind of middle-class people, they're just as working-class as the people in Hull you tried and failed to represent and who you tried and failed to divide on racist grounds. That's our working-class…

[0:00:04] Hi there Fiona. Thank you. Yes my question is do you think it's double standards and hypocrisy allowing footballers, VIPs, in the UK without quarantining whilst lockdown is still in place? Which I kind of think is wrong.
Fiona Bruce
[0:00:22] So you obviously, you do think it's hypocritical, so this is about 2500 EUFA dignitaries and sponsors are going to be allowed to come to the Euros final without having to quarantine wherever they come from? Yes. You think it is hypocritical?
AudienceMember 20210722QT23
[0:00:36] Well it is. Because, the Government are asking us to stick by the rules, quarantine and do our Social Distancing and everything else and doing our tests. Yet they are still allowing people coming in from the UK into the UK, sorry, that are not having to quarantine. And that's wrong! On so many levels.

[0:01:34] I cannot see how it can be possibly justified that EUFA VIPs, sponsors, and so on can get round these quarantine rules and go and watch the final at Wembley. Fans should be able to watch the final at Wembley, and we should have and there will be no doubt a testing regime in place. I was lucky to watch Leicester City win at the Cup final. You had to mention that. Yes I was the Leicester MP. We had to be tested and we had to be tested before we went, and then we had to be tested after the event and we had to show our test results to get in.

Many of them will live with long-term serious conditions, debilitating conditions, whether it's fatigue, memory loss, anxiety, and depression. For some, it presents as hair loss, teeth loss. Some suffer psychosis, it remains a serious deadly virus, we should not be complacent! I believe this particular decision around the final at Wembley is complacent. We have got to change it.

[0:03:48] It's deeply hypocritical that you would have VIPs flying in not having to quarantine, we can legally still not host seven people or more than two families in our home. They are taking us for fools! We all watched Billy Gilmore hug his team-mates, he wasn't wrong to do so, when he tested positive for Covid the team should have isolated. If a child tests positive the class goes home from school. If an office worker tests positive the whole office goes home. And basically, we are in a system now where if you can cause the Government a big enough of a headache, mostly through lobbying, then you can have whatever you want. EUFA gets 60, 000 people at Wembley and VIPs in. It looks like Formula One will go ahead at full capacity.

[0:04:36] Andrew Lloyd Webber did a fantastic thing, he turned down the Government's offer to make his new musical a trial. He was making threats saying he could open at full capacity. They offered him a trial. He turned it down. He knows most of the theatre industry does not have his clout and power to get what they want. It is deeply hypocritical and unfair at the G7 as well that ministers behind the scenes, long lens cameras capturing them, Boris Johnson the leaders of the world, and standing up drinking, not Social Distancing, and there really seems to be one rule for people who are in Government, or have access to the Government, and another rule now for everybody else. If it is safe enough for Matt Hancock and Michael Gove to be sitting in VIP at Wembley watching the football, I hope they had a delightful time, it is safe enough for us to watch a few more friends over to watch the football in our home.

Welsh supporters can't go. Because Amsterdam decided that due to the variant in the UK they do not want Welsh supporters traveling there.

[0:06:30] 250,000 children missed school last week because of Covid-related stuff. The vast majority of them have not got Covid. They had been in contact with somebody with Covid. Unfortunately they are not football players, they did have to isolate.

[0:06:44] Funnily enough, Boris Johnson once upon a time said education was really important. Yet, after the G7, Cornwall a county with very, very few infections spiked-up especially around Carbis Bay, and Falmouth where the journalists were. What's the communication? I now really don't understand the rules even though I read them because it's one rule for them, and the rest of it for us! Are we really going to get rid of all the marvellous benefits we have had from our fantastic vaccine programme by squandering it?

[0:07:24] Robert? You are not getting a lot of support so far this idea of letting in the EUFA dignitaries and sponsors, isn't it time for the Government to be upfront and say this is a trade off we wanted the finals here. We are trying to get in the joint bid for the World Cup in 2030 and support, so that's the trade off. Just be upfront with people?

[00:01:40] Thank you, Fiona. Do you think that this pandemic has been managed better by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland than it has by Boris Johnson in England?
Fiona Bruce
[00:01:52] Kate.
Kate Forbes
[00:01:54] Well, I don’t think it is a competition because every government is responsible with the trust of the people to manage this pandemic in a way that sees the virus suppressed and also trying to manage the other harms, whether those are economic, social or other health harms. We’ve seen from some of the polling, certainly even this week, that, I think, about three-quarters of people in Scotland are satisfied with the way that Nicola Sturgeon has handled the pandemic.
Fiona Bruce
[00:02:18] She is handling it better-than-Boris Johnson?
Kate Forbes
[00:02:24] I think it is one of the most challenging situations for any leader to be in. At the very beginning she said we’re going to make mistakes. She has been upfront right throughout with integrity and honesty that things have been challenging.

[00:02:38] Scotland has an infection growth rate than England.
Kate Forbes
[00:02:46] We also have the lowest 100,000, those are the figures that matter. Because we suppressed it so low during the summer, schools and universities went back earlier, we’re seeing figures increase which is why early action is key to avoid a complete lockdown. I think that Nicola Sturgeon has done that. Certainly this week’s figures in terms of dissatisfaction with the prime minister in Scotland is very high. It is almost the inverse; 76 percent are dissatisfied with the way the prime minister has handled it. From my perspective, the challenge for every government, not just the UK but across the world, is to suppress the virus, keep the trust of the people and ensure we manage these other harms in terms of the economy or society more widely.

[00:03:30] Diane’s question is very pointed. Who is managing it better?
David Ross
[00:03:36] I don’t think you can treat this as a competition. When people continue to lose their lines of business, when people continue to be infected at an alarming rate. But we have to look across the UK there has been a similar approach taken by all four governments. Around the world we are a stranger about this virus, a virus that didn’t exist this time last year. But there have been big mistakes in Scotland and we have to accept that and listen to the advice we are hearing and learn from them. In Scotland we had people testing positive for Covid-19 in a hospital being discharged into a care home. We have to learn from that. Nicola Sturgeon told us there would be a support in September; we’re still waiting in October for that. We have the highest percentage of deaths in the care home setting anywhere in the UK here in Scotland. So no one can claim a success. It is a battle that we are all still fighting. It is one that continues to take lives. It is one we are still trying to get on top of. That’s just the health battle. We also have the economic response to deal with as well.

Fiona Bruce
[00:04:46] What, the UK government has done wrong.
David Ross
[00:04:48] At some time we’ll say this or that should have been done differently. But I don’t think no one can say what has been the big difference in Scotland. What has the Scottish government done differently from the UK. There are areas where the Scottish government have to learn, for example, testing positive people for Covid-19 in a hospital and putting them into a care home. That’s the worst thing that could have happened.

[00:05:12] So with regard to mistakes and Nicola Sturgeon, what is the evidence that the First Minister has used in justifying her decision to crush the hospitality sector and saying the spike has come from pubs, bars and restaurant?

[00:05:28] I’m going to deal with the main question. Has it been managed better by Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon? Neither of you want to say and you are at pains to point out it is not a competition. But it matters to people who has handled it well.

Mark, do you feel that either government is listening to the advice at SAGE?
Mark Walport
[00:05:54] Yes. I think it is the wrong question that has been asked because it is not a question of internal comparisons, it is looking at other countries that are doing well. So South Korea, Vietnam, Germany. I think what we have to do is learn from what is working well in other countries. Frankly, I think it would be easier if there was a bit more commonality in the approach across all the countries of the UK.
Fiona Bruce
[00:06:16] We saw the advice released by SAGE this week, the advice given to the governments on 21 September. From what we can see, neither the Scottish government or the UK government are following much of the advice that SAGE was giving.
Mark Walport
[00:06:36] The bottom line is SAGE is looking through the lens of controlling the pandemic. They are also having to balance the difficult tight rope of the miserable health consequences for other people as well, which is the effects of the economic damage -- the unemployment, the damage to education. But I think what we have to do is we need a really clear strategy. I think that has been less visible. What we have to do, frankly, is learn to live with the virus while working on therapeutics and vaccines. We have to get it under control but keep it under control with much better public health delivery.

[00:07:16] None of the panellists have been able to answer, really, who has performed better, Nicola Sturgeon or Boris Johnson. Of course it’s a horrendously difficult period for both of them.

[00:08:02] Select Committee, who do you think.
Seema Malhotra
[00:08:08] The numbers are clearly moving in the wrong direction. That’s across Scotland as well as England. My worry is that neither government are learning from the mistakes that were made very early on. The UK UK government, it seems to me, has lost control of the virus. They are losing confidence. They’re no longer following scientific advice. We have not seen Nicola Sturgeon come forward to follow the scientific advice that came through in the way that it did from SAGE. Under the SNP government you’ve already mentioned that we have the highest R rate in the UK. Both governments were far too slow in setting up test, track and isolate or test and protect. And my worry is with those businesses and livelihoods at stake now, if we don’t have a way that both governments are going to learn from what has gone wrong and be honest and open about it and work together more closely, we are going to go into a winter where it will be much more difficult for all of us. That is why Labour has called this week, as you know, for a two to three-week circuit break in line with SAGE advice.

[00:09:20] What does that mean, a circuit break? How would you define that.
Seema Malhotra
[00:09:28] It would be more along the lines of where we were in May with people staying at home but there can be variations on that because we are further forward. What has been very clear from Keir Starmer is that -- from from the Labour Party is we need to keep schools open. I think that is universally felt, we should do what we can to keep schools open. If we are to have a circuit breaker, the estimate being we could save 8,000 lines of business because we get it under control prior to Christmas and we protect the NHS in doing that. That has to be done -- we listen to. If we delay, as the government has repeatedly, then the consequences will be far greater both in terms of impact on jobs and livelihoods but also on the nation’s health and the number of deaths.

Seema Malhotra
[00:10:26] I think one of the critical things is it hasn’t been felt the way the decisions are made and the way the local leaders are involved is in any way near what we need to see. I don’t understand why we have both a UK government that has over many years seen cut to local government, that has made local government less resilient, also the Scottish government has cut funding to local government in Scotland by much more than has been cut in terms of budgets from Westminster. This lack of resilience has made it increasingly difficult. But what we have seen is that local authority, when they have been able to go about track and trace, have actually been doing far better than the Serco and others on who the government is spending 12 billion. Also, the key thing that financial support has to go hand in hand with those restrictions. The government has not had the trust of local authority and local leaders that that is happening.

[0:00:00] Good evening. Welcome to my guests in the studio, Rosemary, welcome to you down the line, and our audience, familiar faces by now. Of course welcome to you at home as well. Thank you very much for watching the programme. Join in the usual way on social media@BBCQuestion Time. The first question tonight is from PS.

[0:00:24] Should care workers be forced to have COVID vaccinations in order to do their jobs and should NHS workers be the next group to be forced.
Fiona Bruce
[0:00:34] I'm going to ask you because you are a surgeon in the NHS. You've had your vassal, you told us that before. What do you think about the idea of making it compulsory.

[0:00:44] I'm quite against it, to be honest. It should be a different strategy. I think people should be encouraged to have vaccinations. Like many people from the BMA community I have a vaccine hesitancy in order to overcome to have the vaccine, to be fair, to be convinced about it, I had to think about it quite a lot. That's as someone who is in the NHS. I think if you look at, you know, over 20% of NHS workers come from BAME communities. If you try to mandate these things you will have people who are vaccine-hesitant become vaccine -- so I think you make the problem worse.

[0:01:36] I've never really thought the answer of trying to convince someone to do something is by forcing them to do it. It is better to give them a carrot than to beat them over the head with a stick. I think it should be a different approach.
Mark Harper
[0:02:00] We are not forcing people to have a vaccine we are saying in order to be a frontline care worker you would have to be vaccinated. Not quite the same thing --
Fiona Bruce
[0:02:10] It means you get the vaccine or lose your job.
Mark Harper
[0:02:16] It is people being driven out of care where we already have a problem. We need to understand issues about why people are hesitant to take a vaccine, particularly those in the care sector. They want to look after people and look after those in the care homes --

[0:02:40] There are issues for some people. We have vaccinated a high percentage but there are still those who are hesitate talent. the strategy that is going to be most successful. But I do also understand why ministers are worried that you would have people in those settings. But also I think you can look at other strategies around testing. The other thing I raised in Parliament yesterday was the issue about people in domiciliary care. At the moment we talked about people in a care home but there are millions across the country who have someone coming into their own home and going to other people's homes. The government is going to consult on that. So I think this is very mixed and I have -- I'm in two minds about what the right answer is, actually.

I think it is part of the job and it needs to happen now, I'm afraid.

[0:06:34] I think I resonate a lot of what was said there. It concerns me that 20% of our NHS and care workers are from the BAME community. The structure should have been to gain trust, work with the communities to get the vaccine rates up before we start forcing mandatory policy on them. We already have a massive shortage of staff in those areas. What does that mean? Can I do it in my employment? We have to tread carefully with this. We have a potential to lose a lot of very good people.

[0:01:59] Well, I don't think we ned to completely abandon the hope of trips abroad a little later in the year. But I do think that the government does need to pause and think again with regard to the loosening of international travel, and let me just explain why that is. Firstly, I think we have a record of failure with COVID protections at the border. Slow in the first place to formal quarantining, slow to mandatory testing, slow to hotel quarantining, and slow to put India on the red list. Now we have a situation where we have the traffic lights, the green, the amber, the red. We've seen chaos in our airports where passengers coming from any of the three categories and mixing together, sometimes it seems hours on end. Secondly, we have this mixed messaging on the amber list.

[0:02:30] We have one government minister saying you can go and visit friends and family. Another one saying that it's only essential travel. Another said that we should regard holidays as essential travel. So that has been a complete and utter mess. Now, the government should think again, what should they actually do? What I say the government should do is abandon the amber list. The amber list becomes part of the red list, if you like. You have that hotel quarantining across the board on the amber countries and the existing red countries, then you can move to that limited green list. There's only 12 countries on it at the moment, a number of which are not accepting tourists in any event. But we have to take a more cautious approach now and learn the lessons, the mistakes at the border over the past 12 months.

[00:03:53] Well, so, the Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Transport, the Health Secretary, the government's advice online all make very clear that all countries are on the amber list, but if those countries have very high levels of infection or a variant of concern then they are on the red list; 43 countries are on the red list…

[00:07:41] It's common sense that we close the borders until we know about the Indian variant and how that's going to pan out, because it's only going to get worse, and then there's going to be another lockdown and we're just going to be in this whole cycle all over again. So in the first lockdown everything should have been closed, the borders should have been closed, no flights coming in, no going out, until we know exactly what we're dealing with. Because at the moment with the Indian variant we haven't actually got a clue.

So I think, as we just heard, the exchange frustrates us all. If I was the head of a travel company I would be very frustrated in terms of you have regulations, you have a change of traffic light system, you engage with certain vacations and certain approaches. So I think there is real frustration. I do think when we come on to talk about why caution is required and what is really happening in the world and in other parts of the world that we can learn from that some of what Carlos and Dale and Sam have said is worth listening to. But it is so frustrating right now.

[00:01:26] Thank you, Fiona. In light of UK-wide COVID cases remaining significantly high and deaths consistently averaging over 100 per day, should the governments reimpose more restrictions to prevent a winter wave?
Fiona Bruce
[00:01:43] Andrew, more restrictions, should the government impose them, given how infections are rising?

[00:01:49] Well, thanks for the question. Obviously the rise of infections is something that is concerning the government. They continue to watch the data and continue to look at the trajectory on which we're headed.

[00:03:17] Well, yes, people are being critical of the government benches for Conservative Party members of Parliament predominately for not wearing masks. I would suggest that over the summer and the first weeks of autumn the situation looked very different out there. But as Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said yesterday, we've got to recognise that we have a responsibility to set the tone and to set an example. And so I was encouraged today when I saw the television that a lot more of my colleagues were wearing masks in the Commons.

[00:01:59] But we're very clear that the best way to beat this virus and to beat it back into submission, to allow the country to get on with its normal life, is to continue with the vaccine rollout and encourage everybody out there who's entitled to a booster vaccine to get that jab as soon as possible.
If you haven't had the first jab, you haven't had the second jab, or you're entitled to the booster, please get it. And if you know a friend or a family member who's maybe reading something online about how the vaccine is harmful to their health, please have a word with them.

[00:03:40] I certainly will be now, given the numbers that we're seeing, because I think we do have an example to lead this country and to demonstrate that taking sensible small steps, like wearing masks in crowded places, can have a big difference. But the biggest difference is getting the vaccine and getting the booster if you're able.

[00:04:13] I think it's a mess. It's an absolute mess. I think the left hand doesn't really know what the right hand's doing on this. And clearly, I love the idea of normal life and we aren't living a normal life. What is normal life? It's certainly not like that at the moment and it's not going to be like that, whatever that may mean, eventually. But I feel that we do need to be vaccinated. We do need to be responsible. I think Scotland, I have to say, is a very good example of what's going on. I think in the south, there's a lot of headless chicken activity, quite frankly.
And it's interesting that the Conservative Party are finally catching up and now they're all wearing masks, but they should have been wearing masks all the time as an example. And it's the example that's important for the people.
That's what Parliament is supposed to do, they're supposed to represent the people and the needs of the people. And so the masks are terribly important, they really are. I mean, I've had COVID, I know what it's like. In fact, in my case, it wasn't too bad, but at the same time I just feel that we are a bit lax and we don't quite know what we want to do, what we're supposed to do. And I think we just have to be a little stringent in our whole policy on masks particularly.

Now I am a nurse who qualified and started at the very beginning of the pandemic, a real lived experience of what it's been like for patients and families.

[00:06:10] You're talking, Brian, that Scotland's doing so much better, but our government, we're now having to deploy the military because of the large numbers of nursing vacancies in Scotland.
So what is the government going to do to tackle that? We're about to come into the winter where everyone has been shielding, we've got massive amounts of colds and flu on top of COVID, and, yes, vaccines are great, but the NHS is bleeding.

[00:06:51] The answer to Allan's original question is that the British Medical Association thinks that the answer is yes. With Sajid Javid talking about cases potentially rising to 100,000, now is the time to implement plan B. Now let's be clear what plan B is. Plan B is a lot of the things that are already in place in Scotland. It's things as basic as wearing masks in certain situations. Andrew has just alluded to the fact that he would support the wearing of masks, and I'm not one to tell UK Government what to do, but why on something as basic as wearing masks, it's not particularly onerous. It's not the most pleasant of things, but I'd far rather we saw an implementation of basic things like that than to resume restrictions. None of us want to see significant restrictions on our lives.

And let’s hear our first question tonight, which is from Charlie Shrimpton.

 

Charlie Shrimpton

[00:01:28] What does it tell us about the government’s priorities that they were forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford so that the poorest people in the country, and especially children, would be fed over the summer holidays?

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:01:41] So, obviously, talking about the free school meal vouchers for children. James?

 

James Cleverly

[00:01:47] Well, coronavirus has meant that we have had to bring about an unprecedented range of support packages for individuals, for businesses, for the self-employed and indeed for families, and we...

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:02:00] Yes, but you weren’t going to do this until Marcus Rashford said.

 

James Cleverly

[00:02:03] And we had…we’d already supported families to help feed their children during the Easter break. And ultimately, we’re trying to get back to a more normal way of working. And we had hoped that we would not need to put this additional support package in place over the summer, but we do listen, the government did listen; and Marcus put forward a really compelling argument and we did listen and the government decided to extend the existing scheme into the summer holidays. I think it was the right thing to do. And ultimately, what we’re trying to do, as I say, is we’re trying to get back towards normality, because really that’s what everyone wants and that’s what we’re working towards.

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:02:53] Jed?

./material/spreadsheets/cutietestrun2September2020,18841,2,"
Jed Mercurio

[00:02:54] Well, firstly, I think we all want to pay tribute to Marcus Rashford for the campaign. You know, what a great example this young man is as well as being a fantastic footballer, and I say that as a Manchester United fan, so maybe I’m biased. But what I would also say is that I sometimes despair of hearing things called U‑turns. I think it stops people in positions of authority from listening and changing their minds and responding to the democratic force that got behind Marcus’ campaign. And sometimes I worry that if we use that type of language it sometimes makes it more difficult for governments to do the right thing. And I would definitely say that it’s something that we should all welcome, the fact that the government listened and acted in the way that it has.

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:03:51] And Charlie, you’re a teacher, what was your response?

 

Charlie Shrimpton

[00:03:54] But, Jed, if you use language such as a U-turn…or if you do the right thing in the first place, you will not need to use that language at all. My experience is that I see every day how these vouchers make an impact. And the difference of a child having a meal and coming to school is far greater than not having a meal at all and it gives them the opportunity to be able to flourish, and for that there is no price.

Fiona Bruce

[00:04:17] Steve?

 

Steve Parish

[00:04:18] Well, firstly, I would agree with Jed. I mean, I think that Marcus Rashford is an example, as have lots of footballers been through this crisis, of people that know the right thing to do, do the right thing to do and act in the right way. I’d also agree with Jed that I think the language of U-turns and all of these kind of brick bats that we throw at politicians often means that we just don’t get to the right answer, and what’s important is we get to the right answer. So, I’m pleased that we did, I think it’s the right thing. I’m pleased that Marcus showed our profession in the light that I see it every day, and long may it continue. And long may the government, any government that we have, continue to listen to the right arguments and make the right decisions.

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:04:59] And one of the things that was so compelling about Marcus Rashford was because he was talking about his own experience of poverty as a child and going to friends’ houses when food was short in his own home. Are there other footballers that you know that have lived that kind of life experience?

",Mascha Graupe,14:06,16.5,14,14,1,9,14,7,1,1,1157.0,63469402:41
./material/spreadsheets/cutietestrun2September2020,25544,4,"
Steve Parish

[00:05:13] The vast majority of footballers, you know, come from backgrounds that wouldn’t be considered affluent. And what a lot of people don’t realise is, what an extended network of people they look after and are responsible for, particularly many of the players that come from overseas. So, you know, the picture that’s portrayed of footballers as being, sort of, young men with too much money just really isn’t fair in most of the cases that I come into contact with. And certainly, I’ve been incredibly proud of all of the players that I know and the way they’ve acted through the whole crisis.

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:05:49] So, Lisa, the question from Charlie is, what does it tell us about the government’s priorities that it was forced into this decision by Marcus Rashford.

 

Lisa Nandy

[00:05:58] Well, I mean, I agree with Jed. I think, I very much welcome the fact that the government did a U-turn on this. And I think the campaign that Marcus Rashford led was really inspirational, but it shouldn’t take a brave young footballer to shame the government into action. The real question is, how could we possibly only 48 hours ago still have been debating whether we were going to allow some children to go starving hungry over the school holidays? 

",Hyewon Jang,7:26,11.5,11,10,2,4,9,2,1,1,1279.0,63469396:47
./material/spreadsheets/cutietestrun2September2020,18843,5,"
And even on the day that we had that vote in the houses of parliament, that Labour had called and the day that the government decided to U-turn, the Prime Minister was at the dispatch box denying the existence of 600,000 children who’ve been pushed into poverty since 2012 and the fact that that is projected to rise.

 

Now, this is a result of an approach to government that has systematically stripped support away from children over the last decade, so that now schools in my constituency have to employ workers using the pupil premium to go round to children’s houses, stock their cupboards, put money in the gas or electricity meter, and deal with rats and mice because the parents just simply don’t have enough money to make ends meet. So, when James says, let’s get back to normal, I say, let’s get back to a new normal and build a better country based on better values when we come out the other side of this, because children have been last up to now and they’ve been invisible. Let’s make sure that when we rebuild this country, let’s change that and let’s make sure that they come first.

Fiona Bruce

[00:07:26] Belinda, I was just watching you there, nodding your head along to what Lisa was saying.

 

Belinda

[00:07:33]

Yes, you know, looking at the root of the question that Charlie asked, in terms of what does it say about the government and, like you say, you know, it took such a high profile footballer for that to happen. If we’re responding to coronavirus, and I admit there’s millions that have been ploughed into this, in order to get to that new normal, how can we trust that the government is going to make those decisions without having the intervention?

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:08:10] Munira?

 

Munira Wilson

[00:08:12] Well, in 2020 in the United Kingdom no child should be going hungry, and the fact that it’s taken a footballer to help the government to realise that and actually change its policy I think is shameful, frankly. It’s not a new issue, holiday hunger; we know that several billion children suffer from holiday hunger normally, and that’s obviously exacerbated by the crisis that we face.

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:08:39] And were the Lib Dems pushing to extend the free school meal vouchers?

",Qi Yu,13:40,14.0,12,10,2,5,12,1,3,0,1138.0,63469406:42
./material/spreadsheets/cutietestrun2September2020,18854,7,"
Munira Wilson

[00:08:41] Yes, we’ve been calling for this for many weeks, and in fact in Wales we have a Liberal Democrat Education Secretary and she had committed to funding school meals through the summer some time ago. So, this is something we’ve been pushing for, and indeed so had the Labour Party and, you know, a number of other opposition parties. So we’re hugely grateful to Marcus Rashford, of whom I’m a huge fan and I wish we were watching him in the Euro 2020 at the moment, but we find ourselves in these circumstances. And, as I say, I’m grateful that he’s forced the government to make this change, and so will many many millions of children across the country be.

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:09:21] Is it a bit tricky, James, that for the days running up to the government’s change of heart on this, you had cabinet minister after cabinet minister saying, no, no, we’re absolutely not going to change our mind about this, we’re funding money through local councils, we’re absolutely not going to change our mind, and then Marcus Rashford pops up and that’s the thing that makes the difference?

",Stephanie Gustedt,17:17,13.5,12,12,1,5,10,4,2,0,1107.0,63469411:48
./material/spreadsheets/cutietestrun2September2020,18846,8,"
James Cleverly

[00:09:39] Well, it is worth remembering that this is a scheme that we had already put in place, we’re talking about extending an existing scheme. And it’s also worth remembering that the unprecedented circumstances that we find ourselves in has meant that the government have put forward a range of support packages at a scale that we have never seen before in British politics. So, we are absolutely determined to make sure that families can put food on their table and that’s why we’re supported people who are furloughed at the moment. We are working so hard to get through these unbelievably difficult sets of circumstances and, ultimately, we’re trying to balance the competing financial and social pressures. And sometimes when someone shines a light on a particular issue and we look again at it and we make the decision that this is something that we can extend and should extend through the summer... And I’m very very grateful that Marcus did that, I’m very grateful we listened, I’m very grateful that we responded.

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:10:52] Okay, let’s take another question from Deborah Norrish.

",Louise Whyman,15:04,11.5,11,11,0,7,10,5,2,0,1130.0,63469398:12
./material/spreadsheets/cutietestrun2September2020,18849,9,"
Deborah Norrish

[00:10:57] Good evening, everyone. Is a delay in learning of six months genuinely devastating to a whole generation, as was suggested by Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of…and the Chief Inspector of Schools?

 

Fiona Bruce

[00:11:14] Jed – devastating for a whole generation?

 

Jed Mercurio

[00:11:17] I think the problem with sending kids back to the school, and the delay, is something that we should all be concerned about. I think that the fact is that the time that children spend in school at a vulnerable age is precious time and I think it will be very very hard for them to catch up. So I think that definitely more should’ve been done in terms of planning. I think that there has been a failure of planning to get children back into school. I think that, obviously, the pandemic arrangements have put an enormous strain on the infrastructures in our society. But I also think that if you look at what is required for children to go back to school, it’s not just the fact that children need to go back to school, it’s that society needs those children back into school, because of all the things that surround children being in school – not requiring child care, and so forth. And I really wish that the government had gone about the planning in a more forthright and more detailed way.

Unknown Speaker
[0:01:16] I welcome the easing of lockdown so people can move on with their lives. Lives is all about risks and we've been under the complete control of the State since March 21st, is it not time to allow people who are aware of the risks now to make decisions about how they want to approach this situation. Given we live in a free, liberal society?

Fiona Bruce
[0:01:38] Theo.

Theo Paphitis
[0:01:46] I think they were trying to keep us safe. I don't think any one of us wants to be kept locked up but the reality is if we hadn't had the lockdown, many of us.wouldn't be here today, especially oldies like me. I think we have had to endure that, and we have to come out of this sooner rather than later, I totally agree because otherwise we are going to have a lot of unintended consequences, that's things that will be a lot worse than possibly, you know, some minor out breaks of the actual virus. So. It's important we come out now. It's important that we adopt the new normal, because, it is a new normal.

[0:02:24] We will never be back to normal until we get one or two things: A vaccine or a successful treatment. When we have got those two things, we can get back to normal. Until then, we will be under control one way or another, and we better stick to it. Otherwise we will be on total be lockdown.

Fiona Bruce
[0:02:42] We stay stick to it. Jess Phillips, the rules are pretty complex now and they are different in different parts of the UK. Is it not time to allow people to make decisions about how they want to approach the situation?

Jess Phillips
[0:02:56] Look, I mean that's ultimately what we want for everybody, we want everybody to feel free and be able to go around and do how they would have done prior to lockdown. But, I mean, where I live, lots and lots of people have died and all over the country that is the case, but in areas like the one I represent, which has large proportions of poorer communities and BMA communities, we have seen terrible rates of deaths and so, as Theo said, these controls were to try and keep us safe.

Jess Phillips
[0:03:28] But it is very confusing for people, and so I think that fundamentally now, people are going to start just doing what they think is right, because it seems there is a changing landscape with the communication that we're hearing. I have had people this week, pregnant women saying to me, well I'm in my third trimester can I go out? Older people who were shielding saying, what are the rules for me? And I think it needs much clearer communication. And also, an understanding that this isn't to control. This wasn't to try and -- the Government, I could criticise them on a lot of things, I don't think they are out there to control our minds or our liberty. The reality is, we need to be able to trust the Government in what they say and listen when they speak and believe that it's based on our welfare. And at the moment I feel that the communication is a bit confusing.

[0:04:26] Steve, making decisions about how they want to approach a situation, is that what we have seen in Bournemouth today where a major incident was declared because so many people descended onto the beach?

Steve Barclay
[0:04:40] Obviously what we have seen is very disappointing today. As Theo said, the lockdown only works with the consent of the people, we have to trust the vast majority of people complied with the lockdown because they saw the advice from the chief medical centre, the advice from the chief scientific officer, they saw what was happening in our countries and recognised we needed to protect the NHS and take the lockdown as Theo says to save lives. That is the measures that we're taking. But it is a balance in terms of the questioner says is concerned as to the lockdown being too much, others like Jess feel it was insufficient. So we have got to trust the common sense of the British public.

[0:05:18] We can't legislate for every single scenario. The vast majority of the British public -- there will always be exceptions but the vast majority of the British public have exercised common sense, have worked to protect the NHS, have made huge sacrifices but it's right now that we restart the economy, because there is consequences to that as well.

Fiona Bruce
[0:05:42] Do you think it was inevitable in some way that we would see a scene like we did at Bournemouth today when you have the Prime Minister, just two days when he was asked by a Brighton MP about how seaside towns should respond, he said I'll be calling on local representatives to show some guts to allow people to return to and support. Do you think that's helpful, given what we have seen today.

[0:06:08] What we have said is, people need to exercise common sense, observe 2 metres where they can, but there are circumstances and I'm sure we'll come on to them from a business prospective, where there are pressures, impacting people on their jobs, losing jobs and livelihoods. And that has health consequences, based on a macro level, but also in terms of pressures such as our mental health. So there is balance to be struck. On the whole, the British public have responded extremely well in observing the lockdown but it's right now that we restart the economy.

[0:07:28] I am a BAME man. I also live with a vulnerable person, who happens, like myself, to be became and we have seen a lot covered on the news about how the became community in particular are very vulnerable. And when we look at the countries who have looked at lockdown, we have seen that there have been some spikes in the virus. Now, obviously the Government, they are dealing with two priorities. So one is to protect lives and the other is to protect the economy. So, I am just wondering if we're doing both like what sort of plan is the Government going to come up with to make sure that two and two don't sort of come together here and that we are also ensuring that those who are particularly vulnerable and those of the BAME community in particular will be protected while lifting these restrictions.

[0:08:16] Suresh you asked the question.

Audience Speaker
[0:08:20] Thank you for letting me respond, I completely agree with what Theo said. I do think that the lockdown being implemented when it was implemented was the correct time. But I think now the indirect effect of the lockdown, nobody can quantify, you can't quantify the massive impact to people's mental health. They have been away from education for six months. People are missing cancer appointments. Cancer is a potent disease. So who -- I think the lockdown should be eased as quickly as possible in a safe way and people are now aware of the risks, so they can choose to accept those, and I think the economy does need to get moving as well as other issues too. So I do welcome the lockdown being eased slowly.

It's actually the cost of the average energy bill, so this is a huge cost to my constituents and many millions of people across the country, and it's a choice, and it's coming alongside an increase of course in national insurance.

It was during coronavirus, in the same way that furlough, for example, is coming to an end this month, because that was during the coronavirus, and one of the good things that's happened is we see more people in employment now than before coronavirus.

We've got children additions and allowances. We've expanded the working allowance. We've introduced healthy start vouchers and increased the amounts of money that goes for children costs being covered up from 70 to 80 per cent through the universal system. So we've done a whole lot of things, and your point to David was absolutely right, it's cost nine billion to run the increase in universal credit up to now, and it was introduced as a temporary measure. It would carry on being another six billion to carry on running. You have to then decide what to do. Do you carry on increasing other taxes that would be a penny on income tax, three or four p on say the cost of fuel, if you were to do that, that would increase the cost of living? So there are choices to make, and the government can't wait until the next election to have to make choices.

AudienceMember 20210930QT04

AudienceMember 20210930QT07
[0:06:25] So, you've mentioned quite a few initiatives that you're doing, but it's not working, people are still struggling and using food banks, so you need to revisit it and do more. If it was a large corporation or someone who was well of, you would care, it just seems like you don't care about people who are poor and struggling. That's what it seems like, it seems like the government doesn't care.
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:46] Do you want to reply to that, I mean, because the thing is, you certainly have listed a whole load of initiatives, but you hear people say, well, so what? The fact it, it doesn't feel like that to us.
Grant Shapps
[0:06:54] Yeah, look, first of all, the number of people in absolutely poverty I'm pleased to say has been falling and has continued to fall, and that's because we've done things for people who are in work, for example, the national living wage, which didn't even exist when we came into power, that's actually increased people's salary at the lower end by four thousand pounds a year. It was not even a thing. Now, I understand about the points that the lady was saying about not being in work and therefore the other benefits which would need to be there to help provide help and support.

Grant Shapps
[0:07:20]
Of course, we all want to help people in society. I mean, I actually accept, by the way, that everybody, the other politicians on this panel want to do the same thing as well, of course we do. This was introduced for a specific purpose over the coronavirus. We're coming to the end of that in the same way as we're coming to the end of furlough. If we want to carry on doing things, we have to be able to pay for those things as well, and as I say, we boosted up other benefits in order to help people through what's been a difficult period.
Fiona Bruce
[0:07:51] Okay, Kate.
Kate Andrews
[0:07:53] Yeah, it does feel like there's something intrinsically unfair about this, like it's a cliff edge for those who are most vulnerable, but who are also trying to work, trying to earn an income, and just not quite getting there. As Grant says, we are in dangerous territory if emergency measures from COVID get rolled over into normal public policy without a debate, without a discussion about it. The government was very generous and spent a lot of money on paying people's wages through furlough, of increase welfare, now we have to separate that policy from the pandemic and have a proper discussion about if we want to prioritise this, how far up the priority list is it, how are we going to fund it, and what are we poten…what resources might be move around to do that? Now, David said his job is to oppose the government. I do wonder about that.

[0:01:20] So let's start with our first question tonight, which is from Alison Goldie.
Alison Goldie
[0:01:26] Good evening, Fiona, good evening Panel. So given the success of track and trace we rely significantly on the public's trust and the Government and compliance with the rules. Does the Panel feel this has been undermined in any way by the events of this last week?
Fiona Bruce
[0:01:46] Gosh! It feels like we have done nothing else but talk about the events of the last week and of course Dominic Cummings. Ian Murray.
Ian Murray
[0:01:56] Well, thank you for the question, Alison. I think it gets tothe nub of how we get out of pandemic. The way we get out of that is test, track, trace and isolate. That's the only way without a vaccine we were going to be able to go forward. With the saga we have had last week, the Prime Minister and Government, his integrity is in tatters. We have seen it is one rule for the Prime Minister and his team and one rule for the public.

Ian Murray
[0:02:21] We absolutely need every single member of the public to be absolutely in touch with these rules and abiding by them, otherwise we will never get to the end of this pandemic. I think it should be called track, trace, test, isolate and trust. The Scottish Government also has a big question to answer here in terms of trust, because if you go back to the start of this pandemic, the ground zeroy pandemic in Edinburgh was at a conference in a hotel. The public weren't told about that. The reason that's a difficult story for the Scottish Government is two-fold. One, you need the public to be involved in this so it can be used to help track and trace the people who potentially would have been infected. You need them to have trust in that system.
Secondly, you need that trust from the public so you can use them to isolate and make their own choices about whether or not they see family members. Trust is the nub of how a track and trace system works.

Fiona Bruce
[0:03:18] Given how critical you are of Dominic Cummings, why don't Labour ask for him to go.
Ian Murray
[0:03:25] Kier Starmer said clearly if he was Prime Minister, he have would have sacked him. When the Conservatives are tearing themselves apart over this kind of issue, there is now over 60 MPs that have publicly said he should go. There are over 70 that have e-mailed back their constituents. We have all had thousands of emails on this. The public are incredibly angry. Douglas Ross said in his letter, and Douglas Ross said in his letter when he resigned this week and I think this is crucial, that many of the public have made huge sacrifices including not being able to hold the hand of loved ones when they are dying. How could he possibly say to his constituents they were wrong and Dominic Cummings was right? I think that sums this issue up in a sentence.
Fiona Bruce
[0:04:05] Layla, can I ask you as the scientific voice on our Panel this evening do you feel compliance may have been undermined by the events of the last few days.
Layla McCay
[0:04:15] Well, it is interesting, isn't it, because it is not exactly about what Dominic Cummings did or didn't do. The question is really about what is the impact of that and what we have heard from our members who are CEOs of hospitals, GPs, all across the health system. People are worried that public health messages are being undermined. They are already hearing that people are making decisions they might not have otherwise made. That's really worrying, because in order for these public measures, whether lockdown, test, track and trace, any of these things to work, we need to have a really clear message that's not open to too much interpretation and discretion and we need to have this public feeling that we are all in it together.

Layla McCay
[0:05:02] Reasons one of the hospital CEOs said to us recently this this could actually be one of the biggest risks to public health since lockdown began. So I think that all of these are key considerations as we think about what next.
Fiona Bruce
[0:05:17] Alison, can I come back to you. Has it had any impact on whether you will be more or less confined as we go into test and protect or test and isolate now.
Alison
[0:05:27] Well, no, from a personal level I would follow the guidelines. I think I've got enough integrity to do that, but I do think that it will have an impact on some people who are just fed up with the whole idea that someone can get away with something when the rest are not supposed to.
Fiona Bruce
[0:05:48] Anyone on the Panel think it wouldn't make that much of a difference, people would still do what they need to do in the current circumstances? This is a deeply unscientific poll. None of you are putting up your hands. Eileen.
Eileen
[0:06:05] Hi, Fiona. I believe it undermines the message, like Alison said, but had it been an MP, they wouldn't have got away with it. If it was anyone else, they wouldn't have got away from it. The fact this person is so close and influential to Boris Johnson is what rocks my confidence.

Fiona Bruce
[0:06:27] What I am asking is whether or not you feel it would make any difference in terms of compliance generally.
Eileen
[0:06:32] Yes, it will. Like Alison said, there is people with integrity out there and people who do the right thing for society and their family. There is other people like Dominic Cummings looks for the loophole and looks for the cheap way. You are cheating society by doing this. Ultimately you are putting lives at risk. Behaviour breeds behaviour, especially with someone so influential.
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:59] Matthew, let's hear from you.
Matthew
[0:07:03] Just on that point, with all due respect to what you have said there, if I am not mistaken, Stephen Kinnock took it on himself to go to his father's place to sing happy birthday quite blatantly in front of the cameras.
Fiona Bruce
[0:07:20] In fairness he said he was dropping off essential shopping for them that they couldn't get. That's what he said at the time.
Matthew
[0:07:27] Yes, but it wasn't done in an overly discrete fashion, what happened there. I don't have any political allegiance one way or the other but I think the public, from what I can sense, people I know, are probably just a little bit fed up with the politicising of things as well. All we are after is if we are all in it together, as the slogan says, that indeed those people in public life, like it or loathe it, you have to adhere to that probably to a greater, extent than the general populous, because it comes with the territory unfortunately.

[0:08:01] Alex Massie.
Alex Massie
[0:08:03] Yes. I think at the beginning of (inaudible) there were an awful lot of people across the United Kingdom who, even if they had not voted for Boris Johnson wished him well. They recognised it was important the Government had a grip on this cricis and rose to the challenge and the occasion.
Alex Massie
[0:08:23] I think those sentiments were reinforced obviously when the Prime Minister fell ill himself. The events of the last week I think have enormously dented public confidence in the UK's Government to handle this crisis because people have seen and understood and it has been based on their own experience and difference between the way they have behaved and the way in this instance Dominic Cummings has behaved.
They can tell the difference between these two things. You know, you can sympathise with the predicament in which Dominic Cummings and family find themselves while recognising at the same time many other people, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, have faced comparable situations. They have obeyed and followed the Government advice and stayed at home. It is not unreasonable for them to expect people at the highest levels of Government to do likewise.

Alex Massie
[0:09:14] I also do think this scandal, because it has become a scandal, it started as a story, but the Government's reaction to it has turned it into a scandal, has basically wounded a lot of the messaging that is out there at the moment. It is entirely understandable in some ways that people will take the message that if there is one rule for Government advisers and a different rule for the general public, they will take the view they will do their own thing, regardless of what the official advice says.
You know, the Government's arrogant dismissal of this, the suggestion it is not a story at all and it is time to move on won't do. I mean, you know, as Esther Webber said in the Times the other day, the problem with the move on idea is that the public is not convinced moving on is an essential journey.
Fiona Bruce
[0:10:03] Keith, you have your hand up.
Keith
[0:10:06] Yes. I mean, I am going to disappoint Alex here by saying I think we should do exactly that, move on. For you political commentators and members of the opposition party, you know, Dominic Cummings' story must be like Christmas, your birthday, New Year rolled into one. You must be loving it. I mean, Emily Maitlis had to take the day off because of over excitement. Move on. I can't be bothered. I have a mind of my own. I know what to do and not to do. What Dominic Cummings does or doesn't do has no impact on me at all. You know, I am more interested in whether there is self raising flour or eggs on the market shelf tomorrow than listening to Dominic Cummings stories. Alex, yes, let's move on.

[0:10:53] Well, yes, and Keith's position is more I am beginning to hear coming through, that people feel there's been a lot of talk about what Dominic Cummings did or didn't do, but actually what really matters is us having the pandemic under control and being able to get back to life, much nearer to normal.
Fiona Bruce
[0:11:13] Is that what your constituents were saying to you when it when it first broke, this story.
Helen Whatley
[0:11:19] Of course I have received e-mails from constituents, as every MP has, constituents who have talked about some of the sacrifices they have made and things they have missed out on. I don't think we should suggest for a moment that lockdown is anything other than very hard.
That is why what's really important is that we now have the infection rate under control and falling and that we are in a position to ease some of the lockdown measures, and launching NHS test and trace, as referred to by Alison, because that is so important to continuing to keep it under control so we can get life going again.

[0:11:56] Are you worried people may now -- the comment from Keith, ""move on and I don't want to talk about it anymore"". I am sure you will not be alone in that. Others might be thinking are there any loopholes in this system we are being asked in England and Scotland to adopt from today in terms of test and protect or test and isolate. If there are loopholes -- it appears there were a few loopholes when it came to going up to county Durham when we all thought we might have to stay at home -- if there are loopholes, should we hear about them now rather than find out later?
Helen Whatley
[0:12:32] What we have seen so far is people really consciously following guidance and, in fact, the guidance has included recognising that some situations will be more difficult. For instance, if you are looking after somebody who is particularly vulnerable, have a childcare situation.
Fiona Bruce
[0:12:47] If you have a childcare situation then, Helen, since you mentioned it, if you have a problem with childcare and you happen to be one of the people who is identified as someone who has to stay at home for two weeks, you may not necessarily have to stay at home.

[0:00:06] Thank you, Fiona. Welcome, Panel. Was Boris's nonaction against Matt Hancock yet another missed opportunity to show leadership and set the standard for social distancing?
David Davis
[0:00:20] I don't think so. With all these things, when somebody falls from grace, there's almost a lynch mob in the press. I watched this, I thought it was plain that Matt was going to go. But Boris, I think, made a number of decisions. I'm just reading his mind, the same way you would.

[0:00:46] We know what he said. He said he considered the matter closely.
David Davis
[0:00:50] He's an ex-journalist. He knows some don't pursue the truth, they are pursuer of headlines. He knows he is talking about replacing his most important Cabinet member, really, at this point in the middle of this crisis. He knows he is talking about the fate of two families and six children, and so on. I expect what he was doing was creating time for the -- for Matt Hancock to make his own decision. That's what I suspect was going on. I don't know, but that's what I suspect. Frankly, if a Prime Minister shows some loyalty, even perhaps unwise loyalty to a subordinate, I think that's a good thing.

[0:01:30] I think I would have done the same thing, frankly, in those circumstances. But let's be clear, the right outcome happened, Hancock went, he had to go. What he had done was wrong, what he did was horrible for all the people that had to live through the traumatic circumstances of small funerals and weddings, seeing their close relatives die without being able to say goodbye, that sort of thing. They will all have felt really, really angry. So he couldn't stay. But I don't think Boris should have done much different.

Andy Burnham
[0:02:14] I don't agree with David on this. I do think so, you need a prime minister to lead from the front at any time but particularly during a pandemic when extraordinary things are being asked of people, when families are not seeing loved ones who are dying in hospital, that is exactly the moment that the Prime Minister needs to set the standards that the country has to live by. Otherwise, it all falls apart. I think that's where we're getting to. This idea of one rule for them, one rule for everyone else, was introduced by the handling of the Dominic Cummings trip to Barnard Castle, but it is being reinforced by the way the last few days have played out.

[0:03:02] I get the increasing impression it is impossible to get sacked from this government. You can breach the ministerial code, you can give contracts to your friends. What would it take, actually, to get sacked?

[0:03:14] One minister has been sacked which is Johnny Mercer. This is the only minister to have been sacked since the 2020 reshuffle. He's the only one.
Andy Burnham
[0:03:28] That's my point. I don't think the Prime Minister is setting the right standards. It is particularly important at a time like this. To also just dismiss the feelings that were brought in Question Time, that many families have had not being able to see loved ones, I think it showed he is kind of -- he is not thinking this through properly. I would say that they need to really change how there is a sense of standards being applied to this government, and consistency.

AudienceMember 20210708QT02
[0:04:34] I think this is a clear example of how there are huge double standards. This was one opportunity for Boris Johnson to stand up and be counted, to show us he does have a moral compass and he takes that sort of behaviour very seriously. There is a litany of poor behaviour, poor standards in public office, to which he doesn't address. In particular, at the moment, with the acceleration of the vassal programme which they keep referring to as a huge success, which it is, I think that's a distraction from what's going on. I don't understand how the government feel that people will follow the rules now when they have a Health Secretary or ex-Health Secretary that clearly can't and won't follow the rules.

[0:05:28] Hi. Thank you. Yeah, I'm in total agreement with people who find it absurd that we have to wait for a Tory minister to do the honourable thing and resign. It is yet another example that Boris Johnson either has no conception of moral standards in public office or simply doesn't actually have the power to sack the people who aren't performing or who are ridden by scandals. I'm not sure which is more concerning.

[0:06:02] I don't say this often but I think David hit the nail on the head there that Boris is treating this as an old boys' club. It is not an old boys' club, it is leading the nation. You put the people first. It is not at all what happened here. It is the tip of iceberg for me. I don't hugely care about this affair story. I care about him giving contracts to people who haven't gone through proper channels, giving jobs to friends and treating the public with blatant disregard. He should have been sacked the moment this came out.

[0:06:36] Just listening to the point a number of people have put since this all broke, which is why should we follow the rules when we have seen those in the highest office not doing so.
Benjamin Zephaniah
[0:06:48] I think David said something really important. Boris Johnson was a journalist. The problem is he thinks he can still act like a journalist. He is a politician leading the country, so he has to lead by example. During this whole last year, five, six months, whatever it is, I've come across many occasions when people are breaking the rules. When they are breaking the rules they are referring to Dominic Cummings, all these kinds of things. I don't think politicians are anybody special but people do look to them for leadership. Right now it is not an ordinary time. We really need leadership. If Boris Johnson or any other politicians feel they can act like a journalist or act like a businessman or something like that, no, we need political leadership because it is very difficult for me to speak about these things without being emotional. Covid-19 has really affected me and my family. My sister buried people, that was her job, then we got the virus. So when we came here tonight, the Question Time Panel, we were careful. If we have the rulers of our country and their friends not being good examples, what hope have we got for the rest of the people?

Madeline Grant
[0:08:22] If I was in charge I would have sacked Matt Hancock on the spot, too. I think that the position was clearly untenable given his pivotal role. Not just in creating these Draconian and inhumane rules we have had to live by but often going further and taking a harsher line than many of his colleagues. The position was clearly untenable. I think the delay does reflect very poorly on the PM but it brings in real questions, I think, not just about public trust, which has been, you know, seriously damaged by this and many other things, but I think about the level of compliance. I think when you get to this level of disparity and complete double standards and hypocrisy, there are enough things where this government has forfeited the rights for adherence to the rules that still exist. It is not just Matt Hancock, which was outrageous enough, but there are extraordinary inconsistencies about what's allowed. When you see crowds of the size we saw at Wembley, exemptions for the UEFA VIPs, exemptions for business travellers and you see politicians breaking the rules, but it is difficult to organise weddings, visit sick relatives, and difficult for kids in schools because the same testing are in place, people are isolating in large numbers and it is chaotic, expecting this endless one rule for them, another for us. After a while that starts to grate on people. We need a return to some kind of normality and readjust our priorities in all sorts of ways.
