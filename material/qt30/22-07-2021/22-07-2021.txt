[0:00:00] Our first question tonight is from Dale Jackson.
AudienceMember 20210722QT22
[0:00:04] Hi there Fiona. Thank you. Yes my question is do you think it's double standards and hypocrisy allowing footballers, VIPs, in the UK without quarantining whilst lockdown is still in place? Which I kind of think is wrong.
Fiona Bruce
[0:00:22] So you obviously, you do think it's hypocritical, so this is about 2500 EUFA dignitaries and sponsors are going to be allowed to come to the Euros final without having to quarantine wherever they come from? Yes. You think it is hypocritical?
AudienceMember 20210722QT23
[0:00:36] Well it is. Because, the Government are asking us to stick by the rules, quarantine and do our Social Distancing and everything else and doing our tests. Yet they are still allowing people coming in from the UK into the UK, sorry, that are not having to quarantine. And that's wrong! On so many levels.

AudienceMember 20210722QT24
[0:01:00] You can't then ask the public to do something and then the Government who are hypocrites to do something completely different. Then the G7 that's another example, and Boris Johnson on another example too, and I stuck by Boris to start off with where lockdown has happened, and we needed to stick by the rules. But now, now, no. No. He has overstepped the mark so has the Government on more ways than one.
Fiona Bruce
[0:01:28] Jon?
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:01:32] I agree with you Dale. You are absolutely right.

Jonathan Ashworth
[0:01:34] I cannot see how it can be possibly justified that EUFA VIPs, sponsors, and so on can get round these quarantine rules and go and watch the final at Wembley. Fans should be able to watch the final at Wembley, and we should have and there will be no doubt a testing regime in place. I was lucky to watch Leicester City win at the Cup final. You had to mention that. Yes I was the Leicester MP. We had to be tested and we had to be tested before we went, and then we had to be tested after the event and we had to show our test results to get in.

Fiona Bruce
[0:02:10] Isn't the point the final might not happen here if the dignitaries are not allowed in?
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:02:16] We have to negotiate with EUFA on that, we cannot be held to ransom. We know this virus sadly remains extremely dangerous. Now, I'm fed up of these sodding restrictions! Am I allowed to say sodding? You are. I'm fed up of these restrictions. Sick of them. I'm also aware that since the first of May, we have had 260,000 confirmed cases of this virus. In the last week, 80, 000. In the coming weeks, because of the way it grows, we are going to see more of this virus grow amongst the unvaccinated. It spreads like wild fire amongst the unvaccinated, Matt Hancock's words.
7:42
Part 5
Words: 104
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:02:54] Yes, for those who are vaccinated, the link between hospitalisations and deaths has been reduced but it's not been severed, and many of those people who get the virus today, tomorrow, next week even if they don't end up in hospital, although some of them will. Many of them will live with long-term serious conditions, debilitating conditions, whether it's fatigue, memory loss, anxiety, and depression. For some, it presents as hair loss, teeth loss. Some suffer psychosis, it remains a serious deadly virus, we should not be complacent! I believe this particular decision around the final at Wembley is complacent. We have got to change it.

Fiona Bruce
[0:03:42] Kate?
Kate Andrews
[0:03:48] It's deeply hypocritical that you would have VIPs flying in not having to quarantine, we can legally still not host seven people or more than two families in our home. They are taking us for fools! We all watched Billy Gilmore hug his team-mates, he wasn't wrong to do so, when he tested positive for Covid the team should have isolated. If a child tests positive the class goes home from school. If an office worker tests positive the whole office goes home. And basically, we are in a system now where if you can cause the Government a big enough of a headache, mostly through lobbying, then you can have whatever you want. EUFA gets 60, 000 people at Wembley and VIPs in. It looks like Formula One will go ahead at full capacity.

Part 7

Kate Andrews
[0:04:36] Andrew Lloyd Webber did a fantastic thing, he turned down the Government's offer to make his new musical a trial. He was making threats saying he could open at full capacity. They offered him a trial. He turned it down. He knows most of the theatre industry does not have his clout and power to get what they want. It is deeply hypocritical and unfair at the G7 as well that ministers behind the scenes, long lens cameras capturing them, Boris Johnson the leaders of the world, and standing up drinking, not Social Distancing, and there really seems to be one rule for people who are in Government, or have access to the Government, and another rule now for everybody else. If it is safe enough for Matt Hancock and Michael Gove to be sitting in VIP at Wembley watching the football, I hope they had a delightful time, it is safe enough for us to watch a few more friends over to watch the football in our home.

Fiona Bruce
[0:05:36] The Government is insisting rules were followed at the G7. The pictures were there.
AudienceMember 20210722QT08
[0:05:42] Thank you, has hypocrisy, and about the closest thing I can say are Robert is I'm Welsh as well and that's about the level I can draw. On the news tonight, Welsh supporters have been turned away from Amsterdam airport, because they can't go and see the game in Amsterdam which is being played on Saturday night against Denmark, Denmark supporters can go. Welsh supporters can't go. Because Amsterdam decided that due to the variant in the UK they do not want Welsh supporters traveling there. It's hypocrisy that EUFA can come here from any country in the world yet we can't go as supporters to any other part of the world. Total hypocrisy.
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:26] Aryan?
AudienceMember 20210722QT09
[0:06:30] 250,000 children missed school last week because of Covid-related stuff. The vast majority of them have not got Covid. They had been in contact with somebody with Covid. Unfortunately they are not football players, they did have to isolate.

AudienceMember 20210722QT09
[0:06:44] Funnily enough, Boris Johnson once upon a time said education was really important. Yet, after the G7, Cornwall a county with very, very few infections spiked-up especially around Carbis Bay, and Falmouth where the journalists were. What's the communication? I now really don't understand the rules even though I read them because it's one rule for them, and the rest of it for us! Are we really going to get rid of all the marvellous benefits we have had from our fantastic vaccine programme by squandering it?
Fiona Bruce
[0:07:24] Robert? You are not getting a lot of support so far this idea of letting in the EUFA dignitaries and sponsors, isn't it time for the Government to be upfront and say this is a trade off we wanted the finals here. We are trying to get in the joint bid for the World Cup in 2030 and support, so that's the trade off. Just be upfront with people?
Robert Buckland
[0:07:44] I'm absolutely getting loud and clear the message from the panel and others about the you know, how far we have all come together, and how at this late stage some things appear to be frankly, you know, a juxtaposition, a contradiction.
Fiona Bruce
[0:08:00] Hypocritical is the word. Do you think it's hypocritical in
7:46
Part 10
Words: 181
Robert Buckland
[0:08:04] Look when I first heard about this I asked a lot of questions and you know, I was asking myself a lot of questions about what was going on here. I mean John Whittingdale the minister yesterday made an announcement with the circumstances in which these people would come which sounds to me akin to almost hotel quarantine in the sense they would only be allowed to stay in a designated place, travel in designated transport units, and stay away from other people akin to I suppose a work visit.
Fiona Bruce
[0:08:38] What's the rationale? The reason the Government is doing this risking the wroth of so many people?
Robert Buckland
[0:08:44] I think the rationale is putting it absolutely straight that we want to attract a major international football tournament to the UK. I think that they bring a lot of joy, and they bring a lot of revenue for our businesses and our industries across the country, and therefore it is right that we do try and play on that stage to use an unfortunate pun but I want to come back to the developing information that I'm getting about the circumstances, there are still negotiations going on with EUFA to how this would work.

Part 11
Words: 193
Robert Buckland
[0:09:18] I think the message has to go out loud and clear that this isn't some sort of jolly. It should be very much a focused event. Come on Robert. It shouldn't be a jolly. Going to a footy match. Look I get the point, I get the point and anything sounding like watching a football match sounds like a jolly
Caroline Lucas
[0:09:38] Yes. Robert.
Robert Buckland
[0:09:42] If it is curtailed it is doable. I accept these are very difficult moments for all of us. I don't pretend this is easy, and there will be other occasions people will say hold on, why does it seem so contradictory, that's where we are at towards the end stages of this common endeavour, and I accept that there will be difficulties like this.
Caroline Lucas
[0:10:00] I don't think Robert really believes what he is saying! It doesn't stack up frankly this stinks as Dale said, it stinks. It is deep hypocrisy. You know, it's Barnard Castle all over again. That means it's dangerous too. At that point people lost confidence in what they were being asked to do, everyone has made such huge sacrifices and they have seen that thrown back in their faces back then with Cummings going to the castle and then the Government putting out the red carpet. It's dangerous because it undermines confidence in the measures.
7:47
Part 12
Words: 212
Caroline Lucas
[0:10:40] No matter what Robert says about the extra provisions you are still going to have more people close together and coming in from other countries while the Delta variant isn't circulating like it is in this country. Let's remember why it is circulating so much and that's because Boris Johnson was to inept and incompetent and irresponsible, he left three weeks before he put India on the red list and in that time we have the Delta variant circulating so much! And you know Boris Johnson says he is going to make, sensible accommodations with EUFA. What about making sensible accommodations people might argue with those people that haven't been able to see loved-ones for maybe near or two years now. What about sensible accommodations for people who desperately want to have more than 30 people at a wedding! This is just typical of a Government that runs the country in a divisive way that has double standards at its heart, it stinks.
Fiona Bruce
[0:11:36] Does anyone in our audience, and depleted in numbers for the reasons we know. Anyone support the decision? Charlie let's hear from you.
AudienceMember 20210722QT11
[0:11:44] Yes, I'm just actually, while this is going on I was googling figures. There are 10,000 deaths in the last week um... according to you know, the Government bodies of which 93 were Covid. Now know it's less than 1%, it's way, way down.
7:48
Part 13
Words: 227
AudienceMember 20210722QT11
[0:12:04] The vaccination programme has really done a fantastic job in reducing deaths. Yes, there are 20-30-year-olds who are getting the disease. Yes it's going to teenagers, and it will go round. It's not killing people to much any more, it's not doing that. We have a chance to liberate things. As Robert said, OK, sometimes we have to play one thing against another, do we want a Cup final, 60, 000 people to enjoy themselves?
Fiona Bruce
[0:12:40] Do we want --
AudienceMember 20210722QT12
[0:12:42] We have to play it.
Fiona Bruce
[0:12:42] Victor?
Victor Adebowale
[0:12:46] Well, I think um... I think Aryan got it right actually and the fact of the matter is we need clarity, we need communication, and caution. The fact, you know, if we have -- I am worried that we are going to create a super-spreader event. It's not so much that these people are going to come into London, it's also what, how that will be perceived by the people watching it. You know at the moment.
Fiona Bruce
[0:13:10] Do you mean dignitaries will come in without quarantine or the 60, 000 fans?
Victor Adebowale
[0:13:16] It's the whole thing and the dignitaries. The fact of the matter is I'm looking at, I saw the NHS Confederation represents Acute Trusts, mate trusts, to give you an idea last week one of my members declared a black alert. That means that they are over capacity. A lot of my members are at 95% bed occupancy, we have ten million people, additional people requiring mental health support, we have 5. 1 million people on elective surgery, we have exhausted staff.
7:48
Part 14
Words: 249
Victor Adebowale
[0:13:48] If you are going to ask me whether we should risk that for a football match, I like football kind of, my answer is no! It's not worth it. There's no wealth without health. So, my view is caution. Honestly, negotiations around this Covid doesn't negotiate. I think we know that. It does not negotiate. It doesn't care who you are, or how important the event is, it will spread. In London, just to be clear, there's a lot of work to do in London, we have got 37% of adults have had two doses and we are talking about bringing a load of people into a place where we have still got work to do to bring the vaccinations up to standard. Now, I understand the pressures, I really do. I can see it. It's a balance. It's not easy. I'm not here to slag off one party or the other. I can understand it. But the science, and the evidence says no, we shouldn't be doing it. I tell you the fact of the matter is when people watch this, they will think hang on a minute, if they are doing it, why shouldn't I do it? We have got to this position because people like you have obeyed the rules. So we should be really cautious, we should be really clear about what we are saying to people. We should be consistent. Otherwise, this virus will not go away.
Fiona Bruce
[0:15:06] Kate?
Kate Andrews
[0:15:10] Yes. We should be cautious, we should be smart. But we do need to acknowledge the science.
7:50
Part 15
Words: 226
Kate Andrews
[0:15:16] The science says vaccines work, they are more effective than we ever dreamed they could be. Especially against the Delta variant, Charlie from the audience is completely right Covid patients are taking up roughly 1% of hospital beds right now, and the stats Victor pointed out we have very serious problems about waiting lists and that's another topic. But in terms of capacity, this isn't particularly abnormal for the NHS that's what you get with a rationing system that doesn't supply as many resources. The issue with this isn't that we are being too cautious, it's that we are picking and choosing who gets their liberty back. We are picking and choosing who gets to be free. If you enjoy the football and you happen to get a ticket and you happen to be somebody who is wealthy enough that's on a list defined as a VIP then you get to enjoy yourself. If you would like to go to the theatre or have friends around to your home for a birthday party, you still can't do that. That's the problem. We are projecting to the world with the G7 with the football that Britain is open that everything is back to normal, that it looks something like Israel does, thanks to their vaccine success as well. We could be like that! But we all know the reality at the moment is actually quite different.
7:51
Part 16
Words: 213
Kate Andrews
[0:16:28] Freedom day was delayed, many of us are still not able to live the lives we would like to live. We are pretending to the world that we are back to normal with these mass events, it's one of the reasons that they are getting status, and they are allowed to go ahead. We know something different is happening and my concern is that the Government is becoming complacent. They are buying-into that projection, they are buying into the idea that's what Britain looks like, but we know on a day-to-day basis unfortunately for many people it doesn't.
Victor Adebowale
[0:16:58] It's important like half of what you said there I absolutely agree with but I happen to face the people on the frontline doing the work. The fact of the matter is when I say 95% of occupancy is true, they are worried we might have 1500 people now with Covid in hospital but it is increasing. If I may, and it's increasing! On top of that they have to cope with the demand that's been delayed. So, you know I agree with you on the sight of this, it looks bad, it is challenging but we have to acknowledge the pressures are real in the NHS. They are not making this up. It's not a fantasy, they are real. And we have to be cautious.
7:51
Part 17
Words: 244
Kate Andrews
[0:17:44] They are very real pressures. They have been there since long before the pandemic.
Victor Adebowale
[0:17:48] The pandemic has made them worse, and that's what I thought we might agree on.
Kate Andrews
[0:17:54] And if we are to follow the data, and not the dates, the SAGE scenario for where we would be at hospitalisations right now is significantly higher than where we actually are. I don't want us to talk-down the huge success of the vaccines, and we immediate to follow the idea of the NHS being overwhelmed is deeply frightened but there's really good reason at the moment looking at the data as it is, we know things could change, to think that the link between infection and hospitalisation is not just watered-down. There is quite a good break. We all keep an open mind on these things and the Prime Minister and his freedom delay, wanted to buy himself more time to look at the data. It's looking really positive, and I think we should be quite cheerful about that.
Victor Adebowale
[0:18:38] The data is softening the link but it's not broken that's the point I was trying to make, and that's about the caution.
Caroline Lucas
[0:18:44] I think there's a real concern about
Victor Adebowale
[0:18:44] Just saying
Caroline Lucas
[0:18:48] And vaccination alone is not the way out of this. Of course it's been amazing and all credit to everyone. But on its own it's not going to get us to safety. Interestingly Kate mentioned Israel, and it's seeing cases going back up again. The point is we need to put in place something that this Government has failed to do from the start which is the basic Public Health provisions around test, trace, and supported isolation so that we are not only relying on the vaccination.
7:52
Part 18
Words: 225
Caroline Lucas
[0:19:12] We still need that basic ability to be able to ensure that someone can self-isolate if they have tested positive. Right now we know huge numbers of people aren't doing that, they can't afford to. So that has to be part of this overall Covid suppression strategy. We have got nearly two million people it was said today who are living with long Covid, that can have debilitating impacts, I have been part of the all-party group on coronavirus, we have taken evidence from people with long Covid. It's not just people being a bit short of breath it's people running marathons one month and in wheelchairs the next. It's deeply serious. Let u forget that we don't have all of the population vaccinated yet. A little bit more caution for a little bit longer along with Public Health measures put in place will get us to the place that all of us really want to be!
Fiona Bruce
[0:20:06] OK. I'm going to move on. We have got other questions that a lot of you wanted to hear asked. Let's move on to the question from Gary.
AudienceMember 20210722QT13
[0:20:16] Good evening all. Considering no variance of concerns were detected by on any flights returning from the 167 amber list countries, between March 20th and June 9th when will the Government acknowledge that travelers returning from green and amber countries pose little risk to the British public and allow vaccinated people to travel without restriction?
7:54
Part 19
Words: 231
Fiona Bruce
[0:20:42] Now the list has been increased today of countries on the green list, in terms of very popular holiday destinations for British tourists, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, they are still on the amber list.
Kate Andrews
[0:20:56] Look, I think it's a bit rich for this Government to be talking about continuing to curb our ability to travel in and out of the countries so greatly when its own ministers were traveling during the first lockdown. You had Foreign Minister Wendy Morton in Greece in April taking a lovely tour in Athens to talk about climate change. You had Greg Hands in March in Croatia, he did a tour in Slovenia I think as well. He flew back to the England where two people were just about to be allowed to sit on a park bench together. Ministers and special advisers haven't had to quarantine in this process and haven't had to do testing if they don't want to. This feeds into the idea of one rule for some and a different rule for others. But, I almost have to take issue with the premise of the question because as somebody who has had their first jab and very excited to get their second I think we still have a few issues here. We are always going to be living with the hypothetical of a new variant, and again we should be on top of this, and we should be concerned if there really is evidence it can undermine the vaccines.
7:56
Part 20
Words: 190
Kate Andrews
[0:22:06] If we are going to start talking about a two-tiered society where people who have been vaccinated have certain liberties returned, and people who haven't don't, that can't just happen through an update, through the travel secretary, through the Transport Secretary, it can't happen through an update at a press conference. It's got to happen in Parliament. There has to be a proper debate and scrutiny over the idea of a two-tier system. I would also just flag that if you do bring it in, especially in the near future, the people who are going to be left out of that are younger people who have stayed home for months over the past 18 months.
Fiona Bruce
[0:22:46] Let's put this to the Government OK. I know they said today that people who have had two jabs, unlike Kate, at some point perhaps you will tell us when, will be told that they can go to amber list countries. What about everybody else? When will we know and what about everybody else?
Robert Buckland
[0:23:04] The announcement has come just this evening, the plan will be to announce the details before the 19th of July, so that people can plan ahead, and indeed those organisations responsible for you know, airports etc can also start to plan ahead.
7:57
Part 21
Words: 158
Robert Buckland
[0:23:20] The idea is I think a very sensible one, if you have had a double jab, it does mean the requirement to quarantine I think can be relaxed. There are other issues of course, families, children, who haven't had the jab, and indeed, part of the plan will be to work out a system whereby children can be tested so they can travel with their parents and loved-ones.
Fiona Bruce
[0:23:42] What about people like Kate and others in our audience who wouldn't be double-jabbed?
Robert Buckland
[0:23:46] Exactly there will be of course, contingency made and provision made for people who can't be jabbed for various good medical reasons.
Fiona Bruce
[0:23:56] Or just if they are not old enough?
Robert Buckland
[0:23:58] Look, I think that um... the reality is and in fact Kate said in the answer to the previous question, the evidence grows all the time in favour of the break between people who have been double-jabbed, and the vulnerability to the virus. Clearly, as we get more and more of our population into that double jab position, then it does become I think much easier and freer for us to do the things we want to do.
7:58
Part 22
Words: 175
Fiona Bruce
[0:24:24] But someone like Kate we are in a situation tonight where someone like Kate and others in the audience and at home of course, who won't have their second jab by 19 July, or in the weeks after. At the moment won't be able to go to these countries without quarantine.
Robert Buckland
[0:24:40] Let's keep on getting as many second jabs in arms as possible. I accept there might still be people who aren't eligible at that time. I want to take issue with Kate's point that we are trying to create a two-tier society. All we are trying to do is allow people to enjoy the pleasure of a holiday which for most of us, me included, has not been the case for well over a year. It seems sensible to me to follow the evidence about double jabbing, and to now extend it to amber countries.
Fiona Bruce
[0:25:10] Sorry Kate, so sorry I need to bring other people in hang on a minute. Jo I can see you are shouting rubbish at your screen! Tell us what you are saying? Other than that obviously.
AudienceMember 20210722QT14
[0:25:24] I am aghast at these plans, as for a two-tier system, you couldn't divide the country more than by implementing something like this!
8:00
Part 23
Words: 189
AudienceMember 20210722QT14
[0:25:32] People who have the funds together able to pay for a quarantine hotel upon their return great, crack on. What about the rest of us that can't? Nine children in a class of 30 are living in poverty, and yet people who can afford to take their children abroad are going to do so. I'm aghast at how the Government thinks this is sensible, is measured, there's members of this panel that can't even work! Yet for people who have money, who are affluent, they are able to go on holiday. Some people here can't even pay their bills. I think the Government needs to take a very long, hard look at the people who they serve, and make some decisions and give some consistent messaging to people that are everyday people on the street. So that's how I feel and I am aghast. You have kids who don't have vaccinations traveling to and from, and the testing is not reliable enough to guarantee they will not be bringing a variant or any other thing into this country. So
Fiona Bruce
[0:26:42] Jon do you support this new development by the Government?
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:26:46] I would want to understand the clinical evidence upon which it has been made.
8:01
Part 24
Words: 193
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:26:48] Robert says we have to follow the evidence. Let's see the evidence because there has been some alternative evidence today a study from Cambridge which suggests that a cohort of health workers who had been double-jabbed, an international study led by Cambridge, but double-jabbed health workers, caught the virus and transmitted the virus. So vaccination in and of itself does not make you bullet-proof. It's a tremendous success.
Fiona Bruce
[0:27:22] Do you think more people shouldn't be going on holiday?
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:27:24] I think we have to proceed with caution for now until we fully understand what is happening with this particular Delta variant. We shouldn't be here. It's because as Caroline said we have the red-listing it, but we are where we are, and Boris Johnson gave it the red carpet. There's been a mutation, there's been a mutation in the Delta variant where it has a particular new strain that's been identified in around 40 cases in the UK.
Fiona Bruce
[0:27:50] To be clear, the Labour position is not that more people should be going on holiday the reverse?
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:27:56] The Labour position is we should always follow the clinical evidence. I do not understand what the clinical evidence is for this decision. We know even with a double jab you are still at risk from this variant. I want to see what the clinical evidence is.
8:02
Part 25
Words: 234
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:28:10] Secondly the Government as far as we understand are not going to be vaccinating children. Vaccinating children in the United States and some other parts of the world are vaccinating children. So Robert says there's things to be worked out. If you are not vaccinating children why would they be able to go abroad with their families on this scenario. There's lots of questions here to get to the bottom of.
Fiona Bruce
[0:28:32] You asked a question Gary.
AudienceMember 20210722QT16
[0:28:34] Thank you the decision here is the big issue is about our travel industry, and a big march in London yesterday about this. It's almost become the forgotten industry, and the UK airlines, and our travel industry, it's not just holidays that we are talking about. It's people who need to go away on business again to see their families, and airlines are actually really in the last chance saloon now, our UK airlines, they have borrowed all the money they can now. Once they have borrowed that there's no more money in the pot. Nothing from the Government. You see, the Euro governments have given handouts to Air France, KLM, the Germans have done the same, and the U AE have done the same. They have all bailed-out their national airlines. We are leaving ours out to dry. Along with that, it's not just the airlines, it's the whole travel sector, everything that's linked to it, hundreds of millions of pounds worth of business being lost over the past 18 months, and we are almost at breaking point.

AudienceMember 20210722QT17
[0:29:40] Thank you. I agree with some of the panel there when we were talking about the two-tier system. I feel very uncomfortable about people not being able to afford testing where there's one rule for the rich, whether you are a footballer or EUFA or a rich family bringing your kids to your holiday home because you are allowed to go or you are allowed to go to work in one of these countries. I really feel that far from the Conservatives Government levelling-up, they are creating a two-tier system completely and utterly. It's very much a case of the "haves" and the have-nots.
Fiona Bruce
[0:30:22] Are you persuade by the idea the Government is suggesting if you have two jabs, at some point, we don't know yet, that you will be able to go on holiday to amber list countries and without quarantining?
AudienceMember 20210722QT18
[0:30:34] As long as the data suggests it's safe. I know Israel today have decided they are going to vaccinate their over 12s you know, but having the vaccine, you know, stops the spread, but I'm not sure, does the vaccine stop you spreading, I don't think it does.
Caroline Lucas
[0:30:50] It doesn't.
Fiona Bruce
[0:30:50] It doesn't.
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:30:52] Masks. And
Victor Adebowale
[0:30:56] Look, you know, 3% of all infections end up in hospital. Right. I might sound like a low -- it might sound like a low number in percentage terms but it's a lot of people which is why we have 90% occupancy. I don't think it's an intended consequence but it is an unintended experience of the Government's decision.

Victor Adebowale
[0:31:20] I have to say, if it's a red country you shouldn't be going right, amber? I don't get it. It's like, basically, it's either green or you shouldn't be going. I haven't booked a foreign holiday, and I won't be booking a foreign holiday. I understand the pressures on the travel industry. But as I say, there's no wealth without health. There just isn't. And we have to do what we can to support the travel industry, and the people who work in it. I'm here because I want to protect the NHS, and I want to ensure that it's here, and can work through the pandemic and what happens after it. I just think we should have an abundance of caution. I think it's too early, I know people want to get off. I know that. They want to get off to their holidays, and go to Bermuda, I get it. But we can't afford to take the chance either way! Jonathan is right, the Delta variant spreads really quickly. It spreads really quickly and there's some evidence that there may be some vaccine leakage but we have 40 cases of a Delta plus in this country. We know that we start with 40 then it's 400 then it's 4, 000. I just think we have worked so hard let's just take a break, let's just take a break. Let's not rush this! Let's not rush it. Let's have an abundance of caution.

Fiona Bruce
[0:32:46] Caroline as far as the Green Party is concerned, and irrespective of the data you want people to fly less? This is good news?
Caroline Lucas
[0:32:56] We wouldn't want it imposed in this way obviously. I just want to say when it comes to the travel industry, I have a lot of sympathy with what Gary I think was saying we need to be supporting the tourist industry, the travel industry, we need to be supporting them with extended furlough, we need to be making sure the business rates and all of those things are extended as well. It's quite extraordinary the Government extended the restrictions without extending the support to businesses that's not a reason to open up. You are right the Greens do not want people to be flying as much as they do and want to do it in a fair way.
Fiona Bruce
[0:33:30] In terms of what some people have said, Jo and others and Donna saying, you know people, at the moment, people who can afford to go and pay for the tests and creating a two-tier system. Your manifesto talked about imposing a levy on anyone who took more than one flight a year, isn't that creating a two-tier system.
8:07
Part 29
Words: 220
Caroline Lucas
[0:33:50] I would love to know what the panel think about that. I think a frequent flier levy is a fair way forward, and a cross-party group of people who came together and cross-party and no party, advocated this, what it means is people can still go away for one holiday by plane, every year, without paying any more. It's those people who are flying one, two, three times a month because they have got a second home. They are the ones who --
Fiona Bruce
[0:34:14] More than once a year?
Caroline Lucas
[0:34:16] And it ratchets up.
Fiona Bruce
[0:34:18] More than once a year?
Caroline Lucas
[0:34:20] For their summer holidays they have saved up for absolutely of course in an ideal world we are not in Covid that should be able to happen. What we are saying those people that are flying regularly, the more they fly the more that tax goes up. I wanted to come back to the point here as well about the dangers of this virus, because I think Victor is absolutely right, the Government should not be sending out messages that it's fine to be doing overseas travel again yet. Because it does put at risk all of the sacrifices that we have made, we need to be protecting our vaccinated population, and we need to be making more people vaccinated, and so the idea that children can go away, unvaccinated and bring back the virus and spread it further, and we have houred a quarter of million children were off school.

[0:35:10] It's too soon to be doing this. We need to make sure we have things in place like electronic passes so that it's much quicker to get through the airports. We are still having queues, and mixing at airport it's only just recently they have managed to get one terminal where people come back from red lists until people were still mixing and it's too dangerous to be giving the signals this Government is doing.
Fiona Bruce
[0:35:32] Another question from Colette.
AudienceMember 20210722QT21
[0:35:36] Thank you good evening panel. Do the Government take rape and domestic violence seriously considering the shocking exchange in Parliament, and questions about a fall in prosecution as jabber?
Fiona Bruce
[0:35:46] What you are referring to is Prime Minister's questions yesterday where the leader of the opposition Keir Starmer was asking persistently about the drop in rape convictions, it's at a 40 year low, and he is asking a lot of questions about the Government's policies, and Boris Johnson replied, one of his replies was we are getting on with the job, they, Labour, jabber, we jab. Now, that sounds like you took offence at that?
AudienceMember 20210722QT22
[0:36:16] Yes because, it wasn't about vaccinations. It was a quite serious question, and up until then, you know the Prime Minister had a really good kind of you know, what he said made sense. At that point, I was like hold on a second, again, we are being mocked in Parliament.

AudienceMember 20210722QT22
[0:36:32] You know, I'm sick of hearing basically, in Parliament, you know a load of ministers and cabinet ministers laughing about women. Not just women but this is a serious issue! You know. It should be addressed. And yes I did take offence Fiona, I think it's absolutely disgusting.
Fiona Bruce
[0:36:52] Robert, do you cringe at that the Justice Secretary, or a good thing to say?
Robert Buckland
[0:36:56] First of all as somebody who prosecuted regularly with serious crimes, and dealt with abuse cases it's never been a laughing matter. Last week I apologised publicly for the low rate of convictions for rape cases in England and Wales. I can tell you.
Fiona Bruce
[0:37:18] So 1.4% of rape cases resulted in a conviction last year?
Robert Buckland
[0:37:22] We saw a rise at the beginning of the decade and a steep decline since then. That is of deep concern to me and everybody involved in the system. The system has failed because of multiplicity of reasons, including for example, the appalling position where a young woman who has made a complaint of rape is told look we need your phone, we want your mobile phone, we will take your phone from you maybe for months. We are not going to give it back to you. That makes, gives that person an unenviable choice, do they give their phone over with their life on it or pursue the complaint. Too many people are put in that position. Therefore cases are not followed through. I want to change all that. Can I say so does the Prime Minister. I take on board what the questioner has just asked.

Fiona Bruce
[0:38:10] What did you think of the they jabber we jab?
Robert Buckland
[0:38:12] I think at the end of Prime Minister's questions, both the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition like to make a general comment about each other, and each other's party. I do not believe in the Prime Minister's mind that that was linked to the genuine remarks he made, the apology he too made about rape, can I say this Fiona, when he first became Prime Minister and I first became Lord Chancellor, one of the first conversations he had with me was about rape. I said to him one of the big things we can do is increase support for women and victims by scaling-up the number of independent sexual violence advisers, we are doing that now, we are spending this year alone 27 million I want to increase the numbers by hundreds, because the evidence shows that with support, more women and men as well, can carry through their complaints through to proper investigation and prosecution. That is what I want to see happen. That's what I'm going to work towards over the next few years. Victor?
Victor Adebowale
[0:39:06] You know what, I do think that the Prime Minister does this illiteration, it was in his scripted. It caused offence. Because it caused offence to women and we are talking about rape, he should apologise, he should apologise because it caused offence.

Victor Adebowale
[0:39:30] I think the situation is shocking. It's truly shocking as a father of girls, I just think it's unacceptable. What I do think, and I just thought it was a good thing that you actually showed some contrition and it's rare these days, you know some shame, and some responsibility. But let's be clear, there are a number of problems in the system. You have mentioned a couple of them. Resources are a couple of them. There's a relation between the resources we put in the system and the efficacy. When you cut the budget by 50% you are talking half the water out of the bucket and expecting them to put out a bigger fire, it's not going to work. We do need to look at the resources. There's a bigger issue here. I recall a question time a few weeks ago I was on we were talking about women's safety in public. I said then, we need to educate men. We need to create a strategy for public spaces that are safe for women. We need to ensure that women feel safe in public, and in private.
8:14
Part 34
Words: 187
Victor Adebowale
[0:40:32] I think that you know, unless we can take the safety of girls and women seriously, as strategically seriously, this will continue. So, we need the police to have the resources to investigate. We need the Criminal Justice system to have the resources to prosecute. We need the public prosecution officers to have enough resources. More, the thing that really upsets me, is the cases of women that have not been taken seriously, and haven't had the support. It's not -- it is outrageous frankly, that, you have been in Government for a while now, and I'm a crossbencher, I would say it to any political party, it is simply unacceptable that you have women who have been faced with the most shocking appalling crime, and yet they report their mental health, their emal support, their safety is not taken seriously by any section of public services. You have to get that right. You have to get it right for women that are raped. You have to get it right for girls who fear rape. You have to get it right for both who feel unsafe in public and private.

Victor Adebowale
[0:41:46] We need to put some money into women's refuges, we need to ensure that women everywhere can pick up a phone and get the support they need. I'm involved in services to women's refuges. It's just not good enough. So, yes, we take the apology, let's have the resources, let's have the plan, let's have women in charge of that plan, so they feel safe. So we don't have this conversation again.
Fiona Bruce
[0:42:12] Hannah?
AudienceMember 20210722QT23
[0:42:16] Thank you. The Government has announced a new crime bill and included tougher sentencing for rape, convictions, but it's pointless if the convictions are so low. It's a deterrent but there's no deterrent there if it's a 2, 3, 4% of cases, it doesn't matter, it doesn't work. More needs to be done about prevention rather than cure.
Victor Adebowale
[0:42:42] Absolutely.
Fiona Bruce
[0:42:44] Kristina?
AudienceMember 20210722QT24
[0:42:46] I think one of the things that we are missing completely is how long it takes for a rape case for actually come to court.
8:17
Part 36
Words: 210
AudienceMember 20210722QT25
[0:42:54] If somebody has been raped, the last thing she wants to do is to have to not only go through all the terrible trauma of having to tell other people about it, have a phone conversation, have her entire private life investigated for anything at all that the defence can use to say, well, you know, she's encouraged this, it's her fault in some way or other. But if, I mean, I'm sure if I was in the position where I knew that I was going to -- it was going to be made public, and it will be, and this person was going to be walking around waiting for a court case to come up maybe a year, two years later, do I really want my mental health to suffer for that length of time, that hanging over me? I think there must be so many women who don't even report it because they cannot face what they will have to go through, that's the problem.
Fiona Bruce
[0:43:56] Over half of rape victims withdrew from the investigations last year, I mean, they did report it then they pulled out of it. Of course we don't know how many don't report it.
AudienceMember 20210722QT26
[0:44:06] I hear all the panel about the women, what about men? What about gay men? I'm a gay man, we all get raped. It's not just about women.

Part 37
Words: 192
AudienceMember 20210722QT27
[0:44:14] So, this is really winding me right up. I'm really sorry. I'm very, really angry. It is not just about women! It's about men too. Men get raped. Men get sexually assaulted. So in this bill, don't just concentrate about women because men get raped too! And so do gay men as well. That's rife. This is what has been brushed under the carpet and it's wrong on so many levels so now the Government don't just concentrate on women getting raped, men get raped as well. And gay men get raped as well, and I have heard about it. My friends have had it. So, just look at the bigger picture, not just women! And, yes, sorry! That just got my goat.
Fiona Bruce
[0:45:08] No, Dale you make a good point we hear you. It's true to say many more women get raped than me that is also true, not to deny the male experience, gay or straight.
AudienceMember 20210722QT28
[0:45:20] Sorry women rape men. It's not just men that rape women. Domestic violence against men with women is high compared and obviously, men against women is high, but, domestic violence against man with a woman and the only difference is a man doesn't report it as much as a woman does.
8:19
Part 38
Words: 233
Fiona Bruce
[0:45:44] I hear what you say but I'm not sure you are right the only difference is they don't report it. There's no doubt domestic violence happens to men, and rape, but it happens a lot more to women that's the case. That's not to says that your concern is not legit. Robert?
Robert Buckland
[0:46:02] Rape can only be as a matter of law permitted by men but the stigma for men in coming forward, and talking about it is huge! So we get what you are saying absolutely. And listening to you loud and clear, it is part of the strategy as well. We want more men to come forward and feel confident they are going to be supported through a very difficult and traumatic experience.
Fiona Bruce
[0:46:20] Caroline?
Caroline Lucas
[0:46:28] Well. I think that Robert's apology was very welcome and alongside an apology there has to be accountability and as we have been hearing rape has been decriminalised that's what it feels like I think to so many men and women right now who are trying to report rapes. And I really worry that on the one hand you have got the absolutely starving of resources that have gone into the court case and the CPS and the police, and you know police have lost around 20, 000 officers, so it's not surprising that there's less -- fewer police there to follow those cases up. But it's also the case as Kristina pointed out that you know, the current system puts the survivors on trial. They themselves on trial when they report a rape.
8:21
Part 39
Words: 195
Caroline Lucas
[0:47:12] We need to stop this digital strip search. We need to have a ban I think on s history evidence! I don't think that's relevant. It shouldn't be bringing up in court. We need to have things like special advocates who can accompany rape survivors through the system because it's really difficult, and complex, and stressful and so forth. We need to have I think proper review of the cross-examination rules. We might even need to look at potentially alternatives to the jury, and at least an education of the jury. There are so many cultural rape things in people's minds that some people feel they are not getting a fair deal from jury trials. We need a sustainable funding model and Victor is right to talk about the shameful cuts to Rape Crisis centres, absolutely they need to be properly-funded. I think as well we need to be prepared to reopen historic cases. I know that's a big ask. We should be doing that. That is what justice demands. There's a huge amount that needs to be done. I'm afraid this review is basically re-warming some old pilots that have been already studied, and we don't really need more pilots.
8:22
Part 40
Words: 206
Caroline Lucas
[0:48:20] What we need is more action, more funding, when Robert first talked about the failings of the system, he didn't even mention the cuts to funding. That has to be in there. But we also need to have some more ambition and urgency. This review has been two years in the action. We need action now. Not waiting another two years so we have more rules so people don't have to hand over their phones for months and years on end. It should happen now!
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:48:48] I agree with Colette, and Hannah, and others who have made and contributed. I mean, I did think Boris Johnson's remarks yesterday were offensive and lacking in judgment. You are right Victor, he would have had it in his script. He would have, before he went into the chamber, he would have been throwing around lines with his advisers, and said that's a great line Prime Minister, and definitely use that in the Commons, he would have been determined to get it out regardless of what question he was asked. I think he should have paused and thought carefully before using that line. It did rather demean him. You can't imagine a Margaret Thatcher or a Tony Blair using a line like that in the House of Commons to be frank about an issue of this sensitivity.
8:23
Part 41
Words: 178
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:49:36] I think we have got to be aware that the Criminal Justice system has suffered swinging cuts over ten or 11 years, that's surely had an impact on these conviction rates and prosecution rates. I was looking at the data from the Home Office and the CPS, and the justice department Robert, I mean it is shocking! It is absolutely shocking. I mean like, over 5 2,000 rapes recordsed by the police, and only 843 results in a charge or sumons, and 2102 positions and 1439 convictions, massive drops on previous years. So, the cuts have surely had an impact. I'm sure people appreciate the apology that you have made, but the test of that apology and whether that apology carries weight is what are you going to do to turn around this absolutely awful record? This record is on your watch Robert. I have not heard what you are going to do to sort this out?
Robert Buckland
[0:50:36] Read the review.
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:50:36] Tell us now.
Fiona Bruce
[0:50:40] He has told us some of it. I need to get Kate in.
Kate Andrews
[0:50:44] Look I think the Prime Minister's comments were clumsy but I think it would be a bad assessment to assume he was trying to make a direct link to the conversation that had been happening previously.
8:24
Part 42
Words: 185
Kate Andrews
[0:50:56] I have to push-back on some of Caroline's comments there. It's hyper bolly to say rape has been decriminalised and it remains one of the most heinous crimes, and I would push-back on the idea of educating the jury. I think that Robert's apology shows the extent to which this isn't a political issue, it's not one in which we use to score points against one another, and attack the other side of the party. I think that every single politician on this panel representing their parties takes rape and sexual assault and domestic violence very, very seriously. There seems to be very broad agreement that more resources need to be committed to help women through this process and the men who are going through this process as well. Also to help actually gather the evidence help the police with their resources, so there hopefully there be more convictions in the future and not by changing the law, changing the system and suggesting it's been decriminalised but by making sure we get the resources to get things over the line. We need to work together on this. I don't think it's one for political point-scoring.

[0:52:02] Time just to fit in one last question. In terms of decriminalisation of rape, those were the words Caroline you were quoting of the Victims' Commissioner of England and Wales.
Caroline Lucas

[0:52:24] I want to get this in.
AudienceMember 20210722QT29
[0:52:26] Good evening Fiona. Panel. Will banning junk food ads before 9pm really stop us eating what we want?
Fiona Bruce
[0:52:34] Victor?
Victor Adebowale
[0:52:38] Well there's evidence that actually it will! So, I think we do need to do a lot more than just ban junk food ads after 9. There's also something about the responsibility supermarkets, I sit on the board of the Co-op group, I should tell you that, there's more we could do to educate people about good diets, and to educate children about how to cook. There's more we could do about food poverty.

Victor Adebowale
[0:53:06] I think we have slipped into the notion that food banks are part of the landscape now, I don't think that's a good idea. There's lots of evidence that the nutritional value of food banks isn't the same. It's a small step in the right direction. It's almost a Public Health emergency in many cases.
AudienceMember 20210722QT30
[0:53:28] I think as well for many people, even though, taking away adverts for junk food before 9 many people don't have the option of buying more expensive food. Every little helps, and individuals have responsibility for the food they eat, and the choice they make, but I think it's important to consider the fact that for many people, more expensive healthier food might not be a direct option for them.

Fiona Bruce
[0:54:04] Caroline?
Caroline Lucas
[0:54:06] Well I think it is a small step forward, and it's long overdue. I think it needs to apply to all platforms, and I'm deeply concerned about what is being pushed on places like TikTok and other places as well.
Fiona Bruce
[0:54:22] What about the fact you won't be able to advertise you know, a burger from a well-known burger merchant after 9 but you could advertise a ready-meal that has more fat?
Caroline Lucas
[0:54:36] There are anomalies, but I'm glad the Government is beginning to look at it. It needs to be in the context of the overall food strategy, people are right to talk about the fact that in many cases junk food can be cheaper, and fills you up quicker.
8:27

Words: 129
Caroline Lucas
[0:54:50] There's a real issue around social justice and poverty, that needs to be part of the food strategy as well. I think we need to be um... moving to healthier food, but enabling people to afford that diet, and that means changing access to food, and an overall food strategy.
Jonathan Ashworth
[0:55:04] I agree with it. It's something I have long been campaigning for, we face an obesity crisis in the country. Obesity causes cancer, it causes all kinds of very serious debilitating chronic health conditions, it costs the NHS and society billions as well. Although this isn't the only answer to solving the obesity crisis, we should be taking advantage of every potential tool in our locker. We ban other types of advertising, the state intervenes around advertising for things like cigarettes and so on. I think it's entirely sensible.

Fiona Bruce
[0:55:44] Kate we have a minute left -- a quick answer.
 
Kate Andrews
[0:55:50] This is the nanny state gone mad. I agree with teaching people how to cook. But there's no way this is going to stop people from eating how to eat. The whole scotch egg last year was an example of what not to do. The fact this rule means they have to have exemptions for avocado and olive oil shows it's a poor decision. The Government should not be picking and choosing individual products when it comes to food, and the nanny state has gone way too far, we have had too many restrictions on hour lives, time to step back.
Fiona Bruce
[0:56:30] So your own impact assessment says the restrictions will lead to children eating the equivalent of a single skittle less every day? With restricting advertising.

[0:56:44] It comes with restrictions on drinks and food with sugary content. I agree with the panel there's always more that needs to be done with regard to nudging and encouraging people particularly children
Fiona Bruce
[0:56:54] You think this will work?
Robert Buckland
[0:56:56] I think it's a good start. I think remember the audience here, we are talking about children and young people and focusing on them and making sure that they are guided in the direction of healthy eating.
