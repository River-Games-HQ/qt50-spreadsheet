Audience Member 20211028QT01
[00:01:26] Thank you, Fiona. In light of UK-wide COVID cases remaining significantly high and deaths consistently averaging over 100 per day, should the governments reimpose more restrictions to prevent a winter wave?
Fiona Bruce
[00:01:43] Andrew, more restrictions, should the government impose them, given how infections are rising?
Andrew Bowie
[00:01:49] Well, thanks for the question. Obviously the rise of infections is something that is concerning the government. They continue to watch the data and continue to look at the trajectory on which we're headed.

Andrew Bowie
[00:01:59] But we're very clear that the best way to beat this virus and to beat it back into submission, to allow the country to get on with its normal life, is to continue with the vaccine rollout and encourage everybody out there who's entitled to a booster vaccine to get that jab as soon as possible.
If you haven't had the first jab, you haven't had the second jab, or you're entitled to the booster, please get it. And if you know a friend or a family member who's maybe reading something online about how the vaccine is harmful to their health, please have a word with them. Encourage them that the best way that they can protect themselves and their friends and family is to go out and get the vaccine.

Fiona Bruce
[00:02:34] And what about all the people who are saying they're trying to get a vaccine and they couldn't get one, either because they couldn't get one through their GP or on the NHS app? Only yesterday, when I had a look to see if I could book one, it was saying only frontline healthcare workers. That has changed, but just today.
Andrew Bowie
[00:02:48] That has changed today. We're taking steps…
Fiona Bruce
[00:02:49]
Just for the booster of course.

Andrew Bowie
[00:02:51] This is the booster. That has changed. We're taking steps to make the booster much more easily available to all those people who need it. But as I've said, the vaccine is our way through this. The vaccine is our route back to normality, and nobody wants to see a reimposition of any of the restrictions that we had a year and a half ago. Of course people should take sensible steps, that includes wearing a mask in crowded places, that includes keeping good…
Fiona Bruce
[00:03:13] The House of Commons?
Andrew Bowie
[00:03:14] Yes, so, I mean, people have been…
Fiona Bruce

Andrew Bowie
[00:03:17] Well, yes, people are being critical of the government benches for Conservative Party members of Parliament predominately for not wearing masks. I would suggest that over the summer and the first weeks of autumn the situation looked very different out there. But as Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said yesterday, we've got to recognise that we have a responsibility to set the tone and to set an example. And so I was encouraged today when I saw the television that a lot more of my colleagues were wearing masks in the Commons.

Andrew Bowie
[00:03:40] I certainly will be now, given the numbers that we're seeing, because I think we do have an example to lead this country and to demonstrate that taking sensible small steps, like wearing masks in crowded places, can have a big difference. But the biggest difference is getting the vaccine and getting the booster if you're able.
Fiona Bruce
[00:04:03] So, Brian, the UK recorded more than 50,000 COVID infections today. That's for the first time since July. The question is, should governments reimpose more restrictions? What's your view?

Part 7
Brian Cox
[00:04:13] I think it's a mess. It's an absolute mess. I think the left hand doesn't really know what the right hand's doing on this. And clearly, I love the idea of normal life and we aren't living a normal life. What is normal life? It's certainly not like that at the moment and it's not going to be like that, whatever that may mean, eventually. But I feel that we do need to be vaccinated. We do need to be responsible. I think Scotland, I have to say, is a very good example of what's going on. I think in the south, there's a lot of headless chicken activity, quite frankly.
And it's interesting that the Conservative Party are finally catching up and now they're all wearing masks, but they should have been wearing masks all the time as an example. And it's the example that's important for the people.
That's what Parliament is supposed to do, they're supposed to represent the people and the needs of the people. And so the masks are terribly important, they really are. I mean, I've had COVID, I know what it's like. In fact, in my case, it wasn't too bad, but at the same time I just feel that we are a bit lax and we don't quite know what we want to do, what we're supposed to do. And I think we just have to be a little stringent in our whole policy on masks particularly.

[00:05:45] Okay, lots of hands up. The man in the glasses.
Audience Member 20211028QT02
[00:05:48] Thank you. Andy, with the greatest of respect, you're saying Sajid Javid has made these comments, but the leader of the house openly said today…
Fiona Bruce
[00:05:56]
This is Jacob Rees-Mogg we're talking about?
Audience Member 20211028QT03
[00:05:58] Yes, he said that Tory MPs don't need to wear masks because you all know each other. Now I am a nurse who qualified and started at the very beginning of the pandemic, a real lived experience of what it's been like for patients and families. And also my colleagues, who have worked until they are burnt-out during this COVID crisis. But also our government aren't doing the best either, if I'm honest.
 
Audience Member 20211028QT04
[00:06:10] You're talking, Brian, that Scotland's doing so much better, but our government, we're now having to deploy the military because of the large numbers of nursing vacancies in Scotland.
So what is the government going to do to tackle that? We're about to come into the winter where everyone has been shielding, we've got massive amounts of colds and flu on top of COVID, and, yes, vaccines are great, but the NHS is bleeding.

Fiona Bruce
[00:06:44] Kate.
Kate Forbes
[00:06:51] The answer to Allan's original question is that the British Medical Association thinks that the answer is yes. With Sajid Javid talking about cases potentially rising to 100,000, now is the time to implement plan B. Now let's be clear what plan B is. Plan B is a lot of the things that are already in place in Scotland. It's things as basic as wearing masks in certain situations. Andrew has just alluded to the fact that he would support the wearing of masks, and I'm not one to tell UK Government what to do, but why on something as basic as wearing masks, it's not particularly onerous. It's not the most pleasant of things, but I'd far rather we saw an implementation of basic things like that than to resume restrictions. None of us want to see significant restrictions on our lives.
 
Fiona Bruce
[00:07:36] And what about the points that the man's making in the glasses here?
7:40

Part 10
Kate Forbes
[00:07:40] And I think the gentleman makes a really important point. We are about to go into winter, it's pretty cold already, we are seeing the fact that the NHS has remobilised, so it's dealing with normal cases, as it were. And if there is a significant increase in cases, then that will add pressure. Now what we are seeing…
Fiona Bruce
[00:07:57] So what's your plan B for that then?
Kate Forbes
[00:07:58] Well, what we're seeing in Scotland is over the last four weeks that case numbers have fallen. So although they are plateauing…
Brian Cox
[00:08:04]
They was very high before that.
Fiona Bruce
[00:08:05] They are plateauing?
Kate Forbes
[00:08:06] Indeed, and they are falling just now. We want to continue that trajectory, and the way we do that is…
Fiona Bruce
[00:08:11] But just to be clear, the plateauing infections have flattened?
Kate Forbes
[00:08:14] But they are falling. Right now, we want to see them continue to fall, we want to see case numbers in Scotland continue to fall.
Fiona Bruce
[00:08:20] They have fallen. I'm really sorry, they have fallen but now they're plateauing?
Kate Forbes
[00:08:23] They're plateauing, that's what I said.
Fiona Bruce
[00:08:24] Yes, just so we're clear.
Kate Forbes
[00:08:25] Yes.
7:41

Part 11
Fiona Bruce
[00:08:27] So you've got masks, you've got vaccination passports, but they're still not dropping. So what do you think you can do as Scottish Government to drive them down?
Kate Forbes
[00:08:33] I think there are a few things that we can continue to do. I mean, over 30 people died today from COVID. That's 30 families who are grieving the loss of a loved one. That is 30 people who we want to ensure can get the recognition they deserve and the hope that we can reemphasise the need for all of us to follow basic precautions. And the basic restrictions that are in place just now are all designed to keep us safe, and it's the least we can do, for the sake of the NHS, the sake of our nurses, and, ultimately, to protect lives.
Fiona Bruce
[00:09:09] Anas.
Anas Sarwar
[00:09:09] Look, I think it's important to recognise that across the UK cases are too high. I think it's also important to recognise that Scotland had a spike three or four weeks earlier and that's partly related to the fact that our schools went back three weeks earlier than the English schools. So I think we've got to look at the pattern alongside that. But there have been fundamental errors made by a UK government, but also fundamental errors made by a Scottish Government.
7:41

Part 12
Anas Sarwar
[00:09:29] And I'm sorry, Scotland should aspire better than just being a wee bit better than Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg.
The idea that 12,000 of our fellow citizens have lost their lives to this crisis, a third of those deaths have happened in care homes. We were sending COVID positive patients into care homes in Scotland, sending the virus…
Fiona Bruce
[00:09:51] So what would your plan be now, Anas?
Anas Sarwar
[00:09:52]
Sending the virus to the very communities that are most vulnerable.
Fiona Bruce
[00:09:54] What would your plan be now? Is Labour supporting moving to plan B?
Anas Sarwar
[00:09:58] So I think…
Fiona Bruce
[00:09:59] Kier Starmer doesn't appear…
Anas Sarwar
[00:10:00] I think plan B in itself is a recognition of a failure of plan A and I think the government's got to get its plan right.
Andrew Bowie
[00:10:05] Would labour support moving to that?
Anas Sarwar
[00:10:06] And that means getting a coherent strategy, it means getting Test and Protect right. So we have Test and Protect here in Scotland, you have Test and Trace in Scotland, a similar system, just a different title. Tracing people properly is really important. We're still not getting testing right across the country so we can isolate the virus, to stop people getting the virus.
7:42
Words: 0
Part 13
Fiona Bruce
[00:10:25] So I'm not clear. So would you introduce plan B now?
Anas Sarwar
No, I would invest in Test and Protect, I would get the vaccine rollout ramped up. We know who's not vaccinated, we know where they live, we should be looking at door to door vaccinations. We should be looking at pop-up vaccination centres.
Kate Forbes
[00:10:39] But plan B is as basic as wearing a mask.
Anas Sarwar
[00:10:42] Including wearing masks.
Kate Forbes
[00:10:40] Plan B is as basic as wearing a mask.
Anas Sarwar
[00:10:42] But I think it has to be more than just wearing a mask. So, yes, a mask is important, and, yes, leadership matters. So seeing parliamentarians giving lectures to the public about wearing a mask and then not wearing a mask themselves in parliament sends a very negative message. So show leadership yourself, have a strategy, and also, in Scotland, don't waste our time creating a vaccine passport scheme that doesn't work, that is a distraction…
Kate Forbes
[00:11:05] Having a vaccine plan B in England, that is part of the plan B in England.
Anas Sarwar
[00:11:07] And instead focus on investing in Test and Trace and getting testing right and getting vaccinations right across the country.

[00:11:15] There are lots of hands up, so, Heather, I'll come to you in a second, forgive me. I'm just going to get round the audience a little bit. Yes, the woman there in the black and white skirt.
Audience Member 20211028QT05
[00:11:20] Hi, I hear what you're saying about the vaccines and about masks are trying to prevent getting COVID. However, at the moment many people have COVID. They're phoning 111, they're phoning their GP, the GP's saying phone 111. They're on the phone for at least an hour to get through to a numerous people while they're ill on the phone. The services at the moment are not fit for purpose, they're not set up. People are waiting outside to get into hospitals. It really is a bad time at the moment if you have COVID. So what is the government doing knowing that we're actually going to get worse, because we're not set up?
Fiona Bruce
[00:11:58] The man in the stripy top with the glasses.
Audience Member 20211028QT06
[00:12:00] Do you think having 30,000 people descending Glasgow for COP26 is the right thing to do in this situation?

Audience Member 20211028QT07
[00:12:10] As someone who works in education, I feel like it was disrespectful for us to be the only ones in category one keyworkers that were not offered the vaccination. We were in hubs the entire time. We have gone back to full capacity since last August. Some of our staff still aren't vaccinated because of our age, despite the fact we are frontline, kind of. And the children I work with don't even have to be tested. Those children can be symptomatic and still come to nursery because they don't have to be tested. How is that protecting us?
Fiona Bruce
[00:12:44] So you're talking about staff under 18 then, are you?
Audience Member 20211028QT08
[00:12:48] Yeah, we have modern apprentices.
Fiona Bruce
[00:12:50] Right, I see what you mean. The man in the pink top.
Anas Sarwar
And also teaching staff is a really important point. Teaching staff, so if we accept that part of the spike is related to schools going back and schools being hubs about spreading the virus, actually the teaching staff not getting rapid access to the booster programme and the second dose is part of the problem and puts greater risk on those frontline staff. So the lady is absolutely right and I hope England can learn from that mistake, now that their schools are going back, that we made here in Scotland.

Fiona Bruce
[00:13:14] Heather, let me bring you in now. Should governments reimpose more restrictions to prevent a winter wave?
Heather McGregor
[00:13:18] Personally, I would like less restrictions, actually, because I'm sitting here in a room with 60 people in a university lecture theatre. I'm not allowed to do that at the moment, actually, at work. I can't teach a class of more than 50 people. This would not be allowed. And what I would like to see is all of the correct precautions that we're taking in Scotland, I think are very good, masks in public places, we enforce that everywhere in the university. But unlike in England, we are not allowed to teach people in larger groups yet, even with social distancing. And so I would like to see that change.
You've got to remember that education in Scotland, Higher Education in Scotland, it generates millions and millions of pounds and lots and lots of jobs. And so we have people coming from all over the world who actually this time have come back to Scotland, they've chosen to study in Scotland, and they can't actually come to class because we don't at the moment have the same rules as England. But this virus is with us, as was said by Brian. This is going to be not normal life again forever. We are going to have to live with this for the rest of our lives. We need to find a way to work with it, and I for one would welcome fewer restrictions.

[00:14:30] I've been fortunate enough, I've just come back from Spain and had to be tested. But personally speaking, I think the test we do ourselves at home is a farce. If you were being serious, we would be sent to a National Health testing area, pay for it, I don't mind paying for it, and it was tested by a professional, and then you would know it had been tested correctly.
Fiona Bruce
[00:14:57] The man there in the green top.

[00:15:17] I'm a university student myself, I go to Caledonian, and I really feel for the people who have come all the way here and paid well over £9,000 and stayed here the whole time to have online lectures. I've been in University for three years and I'm in university physically for three hours a week. I don't pay for university, I'm lucky enough I don't, but I've come here from the Netherlands, I've paid my dues, and I'm in university for three hours. And even the online stuff, they're trying really hard, but it's not cutting it. What are the government going to do for university students, because we're really suffering?

So once you take that test, you're asked, are you negative or positive? So if that person's not truthful, they can say they're negative, go to a concert and pass it on. There's no protection.

[00:17:02] What is being done to protect women with the reported increase of spiking, including by injection, across Scotland the UK?
Fiona Bruce
[00:17:10] So this is… Ingrid, you're referring to a number of reports that have come, certainly from Scotland, and across other parts of the UK. I'm thinking of Nottingham and Leeds, where women are reporting having been spiked with needles in nightclubs and then blacking out. Also women have reported having their drinks spiked, so tampered with before that. Is this something that's worrying you, Ingrid?
Audience Member 20211028QT14
[00:17:33] I have genuinely never felt more unsafe to be a woman going out and about. I've always been a bit worried about getting my drink spiked, but I just don't think that anyone would look after me if it did, like staff members and bouncers in particular. They just seem to take you out of the club and get you a bit far enough away and leave you.
Fiona Bruce
[00:17:56] Or they just think you're drunk and get you out.

Heather McGregor
[00:18:13] I know. Ingrid, I really feel for you and nobody, as Fiona just said, nobody should feel like that.
Fiona Bruce
[00:18:21]
But what can be done? I mean, that's the question.
Heather McGregor
[00:18:23] Yeah, and what can be done about it? Well, first of all, this is happening in clubs mainly. It's happening in big nightclubs, in crowded clubs, and I think that the venue owners and the venue managers should have a duty of care towards their customers. And I applaud the people that are boycotting some of these places because of this, because they haven't got a duty of care. Now I have thousands of young people under my care and we have a duty of care towards them.

Heather McGregor
[00:18:43] One and a half thousand of them are actually living on campus alongside me and we have a 24-hour app. I'm sure those of you in the audience who were students will know exactly what I mean. If anything happens, 24/7, seven days a week, you just press the app and somebody will come to you. We run a central security service that will do that.
And that is the kind of thing that I think needs to happen. These venues have to take the responsibility for the people that they have on the premises. They are after all handing over money and I think that they need to exercise a duty of care.
Fiona Bruce
[00:19:26] Kate, what can be done?
Kate Forbes
[00:19:28] Well, I would like to think that I could classify myself as a young woman in much the same shoes as you are and I understand that fear as I think so many woman, not just in Scotland, across the UK and beyond, understand that fear. And I think from my perspective, there are three things that I would say. That, one, legislation is really important but it's never enough. You can have the legislation, but there are two other things you need. You need rigid enforcement of that legislation. And I know that Police Scotland are doing a lot of work right now to get to the bottom of those reports.
7:51
Words: 0
Part 22
Kate Forbes
[00:20:10] But there's something else that we need that's perhaps even more important than legislation, and that is a cultural change. Police Scotland recently produced a hugely powerful video aimed at men who are… I have a lot of men in my life who I love dearly, my father, my husband, but men need to be in a position to be empowered, to call out other men who are not behaving as they should be behaving.
Fiona Bruce
[00:20:37] The woman with the scarf.
Audience Member 20211028QT16
[00:20:41] I think that there's a wider debate. I think it's important that prevention should be seen rather than a cure and legislation won't solve everything. I think that people need to be aware of what children and what boys are being exposed to on the internet and that what is acceptable and how people should be treated equally and why women have to be fearful of what they're actually…where they're going and if they can go out clubbing. Whereas actually it's the perpetrators and the focus should be on them and on educating them, that this is not acceptable and it will need to change. And that people will stand up and say, no, this isn't just part of society and that girls need to be careful. It's the people who are taking part and doing this that need to be called out.

Fiona Bruce
[00:21:39] When you say girls like this, what do you mean?
Audience Member 20211028QT18
[00:21:41] Well, for instance, I picked up a lady who's married with a couple of kids, who was out with her friends for a couple of drinks. When I pick her up, she's coming from a house at half past five in the morning, she doesn't know how she got there. She knows the people but she's married with two kids, and how did does she explain it to her husband? She refuses to go to the police because of that. It's been going on for years.
Fiona Bruce
[00:22:07] Oh, I see, so you're saying that her drink had been spiked or she'd been interfered with in some way?
Audience Member 20211028QT19
[00:22:12] Yeah, they were spiking drinks for years, what was going on. Not the jabs, but the spiking drinks has been going on for years. I think actually the only way to stop it is to introduce maybe the equivalent of if someone's got a knife, you know. If someone is using that, they should be looking at a prison sentence maybe for a year or 18 months. That would nip it in the bud and that would actually send a signal to these guys. We're too soft.

[00:22:40] In 2016, the Scottish Government actually produced an Equally Safe Act and it was made a priority to look after women and gendered violence, and it's not been done. I think the Scottish Government has failed on that.

Brian Cox
[00:23:06] This is the question for me, is the accessibility of the drug? Nobody is actually looking at that. How do these people get this drug?
Fiona Bruce
[00:23:14] But we don't know what [voices overlap 00:23:16].
Brian Cox
[00:23:17] The idea of a hypodermic needle, do they feel the hypodermic? Do they…? And there's that which I…it's a very… Nobody is really looking at that element, because folk behave in a certain kind of way after drinks or what have you. But I find it extraordinary. I mean, the idea of what this drug is and the accessibility this drug is and where are they getting the drug from? Who is giving this drug?

[00:23:37] And I feel that we're not looking at that because we know that people are going to behave in a certain way and that's terrible, it's just dreadful. I mean, I couldn't believe it when I heard today about the needle, and I'm thinking… And these lasses having to wear these thick coats in order to protect themselves.
But I'm thinking, where is this drug and how are they getting it? And I think we also have to look at that and nobody's actually talked about that. Nobody's actually talked about what the drug is and the accessibility of the drug. And I think if you can talk about…if you can start to go down that route, apart from the obvious other routes, then perhaps we'll begin to understand what it is that's going on.
Fiona Bruce
[00:24:24] So look at the toxicology of it perhaps.
Brian Cox
[00:24:25] Yes, absolutely.
Fiona Bruce
[00:24:27] Anas.
Anas Sarwar
[00:24:26] I think Kate's right, it's about legislation, but more importantly, it's about culture, and we passed a Hate Crime bill in the last parliament but we didn't include the largest hate crime, which is sexism and misogyny in that Hate Crime bill, which I think was an absolute failure. And I think that's something that should be corrected.

Anas Sarwar
[00:24:41]
But I think there's a more fundamental point here. Yes, the spiking is horrific and we've got to take the urgent and immediate action to address it. But let's be honest about this. Every single day there are women in our country who have to think twice before they walk down certain streets, who have to look over their shoulder when they're out on a Friday or a Saturday night. Who have to doublecheck their charge in their battery. Who have to think about how they travel to and from places. And so we've got to address that fundamental issue.
And for those that think the answer to this is women thinking about how they change their behaviour, I'm sorry, frankly that's wrong. Men need to think about how they change their behaviour because we should not be living in a society where any human being, regardless of their gender or their faith or their sexuality, has to think twice about where they go. And that's sad. The sad reality of the Scotland and the UK we live in right now, we've got to fundamentally change it.

[00:25:38] Gender-based violence doesn't just happen to women. Mr Sarwar, again you mentioned misogyny. Do you know what the male equivalent is of misogyny? It's misandry. There is actually a word for it. I appreciate that violence against women is horrendous, it's on the rise, and it's terrible.
Fiona Bruce
[00:26:05] And is the greater part.
Audience Member 20211028QT23
[00:26:07] And it is the greater part. But we shouldn't forget that it does happen to men as well. Men get their drinks spiked, men get jabbed, and I think it would be a mistake to focus completely only on female… If we talk about gender violence and we only ever talk about women, we forget that it happens to men.
Fiona Bruce
[00:26:31] Okay, the woman here in the blue dress.
Audience Member 20211028QT24
[00:26:34] Hi, I'm a former police inspector, having served in Scotland and down in the Met and County Forces, and I just want to look at some of the aspects of what the panel have been saying about this. First of all, we need to gather intelligence, and if we don't get people coming forward, male or female, coming forward and talking to the police, allowing themselves to be forensically examined, because we don't know what type of people it is.
7:58

Part 28
Audience Member 20211028QT25
[00:27:00] Because I'm sitting here and thinking it could be a EpiPen, because an EpiPen is far easier to disguise and use. But we need to do the toxicology and find out what it is. So we need to do this intelligence gathering.
When it comes to evidence and trying to find out who the perpetrators are, that is a tremendously difficult aspect. Because if you talk to the CPS or you talk to procurator fiscal, the evidence has got to be there where you've got an opportunity of taking something to court. Is there a realistic prospect of a prosecution being successful? And we hear so often about sexual assaults that are not successful at court, and that's one of the reasons why, because gathering the evidence is so difficult.
So where does that leave Police Scotland and all the other 43 forces in the country? It leaves them thinking about, how can we use things that we've used before to support people who want to come and report things? Relatives of people who want to come and say something is not right about this. And the intelligence format is so important in that respect, otherwise, we might never ever get to the bottom of this.

Fiona Bruce
[00:28:14] Andrew, what is being done to protect women with a reported increase of spiking across the UK?
Andrew Bowie
[00:28:22] Well, firstly, it's absolutely horrific, the stories that are coming out over the last few days, and I pay huge tribute to… I think it's at the University of Edinburgh, the girls' night in campaign who are boycotting venues to sort of shine a light on this. I feel a great sense of… Well, I feel quite ashamed, actually, in the same way that I felt ashamed after the tragic murder of Sarah Everard. So many of my female friends and family members tell stories: oh yeah, I felt uncomfortable walking home one night a few weeks ago. And as a man, I just had no idea that there was this…
Fiona Bruce
[00:28:56] How was it possible that you had no idea?
Andrew Bowie
[00:28:58] Well, because so many of them were just, for whatever, so ashamed to talk about it. They didn't go to the police, they didn't want to talk about it. They felt stupid talking about it. And I think this is wrong and that's where Kate is absolutely right.

Andrew Bowie
[00:29:15] This is a culture change, a shift that we need in this country. We need to educate men into the dangers that women face going out, that they shouldn't face. As Anas said, you shouldn't be afraid to go about your business, go on a night out and feel scared to go home or feel scared to ask a policeman for help, or whatever it is. And so we do need a culture shift.
We should also be clear that these men who are going into clubs and spiking these drinks, or using hypodermic needles, or EpiPens, as you suggest, these are vile, pernicious individuals who are going to take advantage of young vulnerable women and they should get everything thrown at them that we can throw at them in this country. But yes, we need an education shift, we need a culture shift, and we, as men, to be much more aware of the dangers that so many women in this country feel that they face going about their daily business.

[00:30:00] As COP26 approaches, could you tell us in the situation of an independent Scotland, would you put the economy or environment first when choosing what to do with the domestic oil industry?
Fiona Bruce
[00:30:12] Kate.
Kate Forbes
[00:30:15] It doesn't need to be exclusive, I don't think. I don't think it's one or the other. One of the great opportunities over the next three weeks, in my humble opinion, are the economic opportunities that come for Scotland as a result of that just transition. Now, sadly, not all the levers are within Scotland and we saw a decision made this week. One of the greatest opportunities for Scotland was the Acorn Project, carbon capture and storage in the North East, the most well advanced project, the most cost effective project. We were sincerely hoping that the UK government would invest the billion pounds that had been promised. And instead that money is going to projects in England, and I think the BBC reported it as jaw-dropping. Now that could have created several thousand jobs…
Fiona Bruce
[00:31:02] I don't think the BBC would have expressed that opinion, I must… It may have been someone in a BBC report said it was jaw-dropping.

Kate Forbes
[00:31:07] It was jaw-dropping, indeed. A lot of jaws dropped in the North East. Whether or not they support me and my party, there was a lot of surprise. Now opportunities like that…
Fiona Bruce
[00:31:16] But what about in terms of the domestic oil industry? If you've got a legally binding target, which you have, to achieve net zero emissions by 2045, when do you envisage phasing out the domestic oil industry?
Kate Forbes
[00:31:29] So this is my point, that with a just transition, there are opportunities to create new jobs when it comes to that phasing out and the carbon capture and storage in the North East is a great example. You've got the infrastructure there from the oil and gas industry, you've got the skills there, you've got a lot of the investment there. Now if you take that and redeploy that through something like carbon capture and storage, with the investment behind it, the key is you need the investment behind it. Then you are creating jobs as we make that just transition.

Fiona Bruce
[00:31:59] Andrew, you're looking very sceptical.
Andrew Bowie
[00:32:01] Your partners in government, the Green Party, are against investment in any carbon capture and storage. And your leader Nicola Sturgeon is unable to say whether she supports further exploration and drilling in the North Sea.
Kate Forbes
[00:32:11] Andrew, a few months ago…
Andrew Bowie
[00:32:12] And we have seen the dangers of not having a domestic supply.
Kate Forbes
[00:32:12]…you stood up in the House of Commons talking about the benefits of the North East initiative and project.
Andrew Bowie
[00:32:19] Absolutely.
Kate Forbes
[00:32:21] This week, the UK government chose to bypass the most advance and cost effective carbon capture and storage opportunity in the UK, which is the North East. The North East economy has contributed over £350 billion of oil revenues over the last few decades. All it would have taken is £1 billion to contribute, to donate, to invest in the North East, to ensure that we do see that just transition from oil and gas to new economic opportunities, and that did not happen.
8:04

Part 34
Andrew Bowie
[00:32:51] So, Kate, it's the Conservative Government in London that is investing £16 billion in the transition fund to move us into this new renewables future.
Kate Forbes
[00:32:58] Not in the North East.
Andrew Bowie
[00:33:01] Yes, in the North East of Scotland. We've invested in the oil and gas technology Centre in Aberdeen, the Sub-Sea Hub of Excellence, which is going to be created in my constituency. £2.3 billion of tax relief for companies operating out of Aberdeen to make the North Sea the most attractive base in which to invest in the world. And in terms of carbon capture and storage in the Scottish Cluster, in the Acorn project, of course it was disappointing that it didn't achieve tier one status. But it is a reserve cluster, it does mean that it still remains in the programme. And the UK government has spent £31 million already working with the Scottish Cluster and I hope that we can advance the timeframe because we're going to need much more than the two tier one projects if we're going to be serious about developing this technology.
And I remain committed to working with the UK Government and with the Scottish Cluster to advance it more in the future. Because the Conservative Party is investing and does care about the North East of Scotland, unlike the Scottish National Party Government in Edinburgh.

[00:34:00] This is not a party political issue. We're in deep shit, we really are, and we really have to face up to that. I'm sorry, to use the Scottish one, I'm well and truly scunnered, quite frankly. We've just had the support coming out just now, it's just been released today, about the investigation, that they've found out that both South America and Australia and Saudi Arabia want to circumvent what's going on. The planet is being destroyed and we have to rethink it. We have to make certain sacrifice in order to get better. And we still want to fall into, well, we can't afford that because we'll lose that. But we have to think first and foremost about the planet and our responsibility to the planet. That's the feeling.
Fiona Bruce
[00:35:00] I mean, the question is about an independent Scotland putting the economy and the environment first.
Brian Cox
[00:35:07] Well, I think they have to put the environment first. I mean, I really do. I think that's the advantage that we can…that's the… I mean, we're a small country and we could show example.

Brian Cox
[00:35:34] Yeah.
Andrew Bowie
[00:35:35] But we only make those advances in technology through private investment and private funding. And you just have to look at the work that's being done by companies in the North East, in Aberdeen, in these brand-new technologies that are coming on stream and are really going to power our way towards net zero in 2050, to driving down our carbon emissions. And by the way, the UK has got a very good story to play. We're leading the G20 in terms of cutting our carbon.
Brian Cox

[00:36:26] I would be so proud for there to be an independent Scotland and there's only one thing that I kind of sigh about when it comes to the Scottish Government as it is. And that's we had a perfect set up there for carbon capture, and I do feel we've been overlooked yet again. But animal agriculture is the second biggest cause of climate change, before transport, and not only has the UK government ignored it, but Scottish Government is continuing with that and I think we're too… We've done this with the energy industry, we've left it too long and only now are we prepared to stand up to these industries and say, we need to do something different, we need to stop listening to the lobbyists and put the real issues first. Are we going to ignore that with animal agriculture or are we going to start to make proper just transitions now because it is already too late?

Andrew Bowie

Audience Member 20211028QT30
[00:37:49]…he starts hitting us with all this thing about we've invested £132 billion, £125 billion, nobody can check all these figures. And the Tory ministers are good at this for everything they do. The first thing they bring in is their investment in this, their investment in that. He sold Scotland down the river by not allowing the North East project to go ahead.

[00:38:58]…to develop and move the plans forward so that it can come on stream. Yesterday was only the start of the story. We're a long way from actually developing clusters around the UK that we can sort of take forward CCUS at the scale that we need to. And I'm really confident that in time the Scottish Cluster will be a part of our overarching plans to do that. But we are investing billions in transition. We're investing in the North Sea.

[00:39:27] Okay, alright, I'm just going to get… Forgive me, sir, I'm going to get round the rest of the panel otherwise it will just be you and the Andrew show. It's on the entertaining side in some ways but I think let's move on. Anas, I want to come to you. So the question is, as COP26 approaches, could you tell us when an independent Scotland would put the economy or environment first when deciding what to do with the domestic oil industry?
Anas Sarwar
[00:39:47] I think the challenge is climate change is a recognised borders. So to turn an issue of global cooperation and the eyes of the world being on Glasgow and the requirement for international leaders to work together, to challenge climate change, to do the very thing that Brian says we need to do, to confront the climate emergency and safe the planet. To reduce that to a conscious debate about Scotland's place in the UK, I think frankly misses the point. The reality is we have two failing governments in Scotland when it comes to climate change. We can't repeat the mistakes of the mining industry when entire communities were decimated and there wasn't a pathway to alternative employment. We can't make that same mistake in the North East.
8:11

Part 41
Anas Sarwar
[00:40:20] The UK government should be doing more in terms of that carbon capture project in the North East, but also the Scottish Government can be doing more. The Scottish Government promised that we would have 130,000 green jobs by 2020, and we've actually only created 21,400 green jobs in Scotland with the powers that we already have. So what we need to do is take the opportunity of COP26, when political leaders, both at home but abroad also, stop talking the rhetoric of climate change and actually turn it into meaningful action so we can change the planet. And that means leading by example.
That means, when we're talking about integrated public transport, so we can get people that have gas guzzling vehicles, we don't cut routes in Scotland at the same time, meaning that our real workers are going to be going on strike in Glasgow at the very time when international eyes are on us. When we talked about protecting the global environment, it means not cutting the environmental budget here in Glasgow. Many of our cleansing workers are going to be going on strike during COP26. That's an idea of shame and embarrassment for our city and for Scotland and I think we can do frankly better than that.

[00:41:27] The economy versus the environment.
Heather McGregor
[00:41:28]…that we are focusing on the things that divide us, when actually what we should be focusing on are the things that unite us. And I think every single person in this room would want a better planet and a stronger environment. But in my experience, the way to get that is a strong economy. So it's not an either/or, you have to have one and the other. And actually there are things that we could all do to make that happen, because we're not going to get a stronger environment by working out where the carbon capture goes or using another reusable coffee cup. What will really make the difference is massive innovation. And massive innovation does not happen. It's the kind of stuff that's going on in the labs of universities all over Scotland right now and it doesn't happen without somebody funding it. And it will not be enough for governments to fund it and we need private capital to fund it.

Heather McGregor
[00:42:10]…So you need a strong economy to deliver a strong environment. And I and everybody here, everybody here with a private pension fund for a start should be putting their foot down about where that money is invested, because it needs to be invested for the long, long-term. And you need to be investing now for 30, 40, 50 years away. So personally, I don't think there is a choice to be made between the environment and the economy because you need a very strong environment to support the economy, and you need a very strong economy to support the environment.

[00:42:56] What, if any, further protections should politicians have in light of the events of last week?
Fiona Bruce
[00:43:02] Anas.
Anas Sarwar
[00:43:04] Look, I think the fundamental thing to say is nobody should feel unsafe at work, and certainly no one should be killed at their work regardless of what sector they work in.
Fiona Bruce
[00:43:15] Have you felt unsafe at work? I know there was an incident when you very first started campaigning.
Anas Sarwar
[00:43:19] I've had some pretty high profile cases around threats that were left on my office phone, threats have come on YouTube videos, threats that have been sent through the post.
Fiona Bruce
[00:43:31] And you were punched, weren't you, when you first started campaigning?
Anas Sarwar
[00:43:34] Yeah, I was punched as a teenager in a racist incident. My earliest political memory is waking up and going out to school and seeing a letter on my front porch and opening it up and there was a picture mocked up of my mother with two…tied to a chair with two guns pointed to her head. And cut out letters saying, bang, bang, that's all it takes. And that was a message from, at that time, Combat 18, who were upset about the fact that we might be on the verge of electing Britain's first Muslim member of parliament, who was my father at the time. So we've seen threats against politicians, we've seen attacks on democracy.
8:15
Words: 0
Part 45
Anas Sarwar
[00:44:00] What do we do about it? One part I think is recognising that of course politics is going to have high emotions and of course there's a place for anger in politics as well. I think the challenge for all of us, though, is not to allow that anger and that emotion to turn into dislike and hatred. We all have very different political views on the stage, myself, Andrew and Kate in particular, but that doesn't mean that we have to dislike each other or hate each other in the process. We can be very civil but still be angry and passionate about our politics.
The further thing I would say is, we can't escape the fact that our public discourse and our political discourse also is part of the problem. Too much of our politics is about othering communities. It's about dehumanising other people, and it's about creating divisions amongst ourselves. And I think we've got to recognise that until we challenge that and we challenge the politics of anger with the politics of empathy, we challenge the politics and division with the politics of unity. And we challenge frankly the politics of despair that we feel as a society and a country with a politics of hope. We are going to continue to see these horrific threats and I hope not, in terms of horrific incidents itself.

Anas Sarwar
[00:45:10] So yes, there's a wider issue about individual protection, and look, we're all family members, our families are concerned, our staff are concerned about their own safety. But I think there's a fundamental issue here about how we do politics, how we protect our democracy, and how we keep that fundamental importance of our democracy of face to face contact and recognising that our politicians are there to serve the people and be accessible to the people, not be separate from the people.
Fiona Bruce
[00:45:46] So the question, Andrew, is, what, if any, further protection should there be in the light of obviously the terrible killing of Sir David Amess?
Andrew Bowie
[00:45:56] Yeah, and I can't help thinking that this time last week David was in his constituency in Southend preparing for a very normal Friday in many respects for members of parliament and members of the Scottish Parliament. He would be hosting a constituency surgery, where I'm sure he felt as safe as he ever had done in the near 40 years that he served his constituents in the House of Commons.
8:18
Words: 0
Part 47
Fiona Bruce
[00:46:20] So do you think there should be further protection?
Andrew Bowie
[00:46:24] The protection should be there if a member of parliament feels that they require it or that their staff should require it. But we've got to be very careful to balance that with keeping the so very important aspect, almost unique in our democracy, which is the openness and accessibility of elected representatives to their constituents. We do absolutely need to do something about the tone of the debate in our politics. We have lost and are losing, and you see it in social media, and I see some of the abuse that some of my colleagues get. We are losing, I think, fast the ability to disagree agreeably. And if anything could change in the light of last week's tragic events, given how he went about his business, a man with very strong-held views, some of which I disagreed with, but he would do it in a courteous, polite and amiable manner, and we need to get back to that in this country. Not just between ourselves as politicians, but out in the country as a whole.
And to answer the original question, if an MP, NSP, or anybody in public service, because it's not just elected representatives, feels unsafe, then, yes, of course the protection should be available to them to allow them to carry out their business representing this country in whatever capacity they are doing it.

Fiona Bruce
[00:47:49] Is that something you'd like to see?
Audience Member 20211028QT39
[00:47:51] Yes, I would. What would you feel like if your young daughter got killed or your elderly father got killed for just doing their job?
Fiona Bruce
[00:48:00] I'm going to come round the audience and then I'll come back to you. Yes, the man in the glasses.
Audience Member 20211028QT40
[00:48:03] Surely now it's not just for MPs and MSPs to get the extra protection, we need to do it for the whole of society. Because in this area in the last five days there have been two fatal stabbings. So surely we need to clamp down more on the punishment for anyone caught carrying a knife rather than just looking at it from an MP or an MSP's point of view.

Part 49
Fiona Bruce
[00:48:26] Well, we're discussing it simply because that was the question. I mean, one of those stabbings was of a 14-year-old, particularly distressing. The question is, what, if any, further protection should politicians have? I mean, you're all talking about if politicians feel concerned, they should have protection. But what should they be? Is it having a police officer stationed at every constituency surgery, or what is it? Practically, what does it mean?
Kate Forbes
[00:48:47] I mean, it's not that, is it? Because the bread and butter of my job is surgeries with constituents. It's meeting people face to face. Now through COVID that's been more difficult, I've had virtual surgeries, but you cannot escape, and I would never want to, it's the part of the job I love the most. Being out in my very beautiful constituency, almost as beautiful as Glasgow, and meeting people face to face. But I don't think there is any politician, I can't think of any, who haven't had to face threatening behaviour, who haven't been subject to intimidating threats.
And the challenge for all of us is that the worst atrocities start somewhere and they start with these intimidating threats. They start with anger-fuelled and dehumanising language so often on social media.

[00:49:15] And I guess for me it starts with all of us again calling out that dehumanising language, because every politicians does have family scrutinised, criticised, hold politicians accountable, do all of that, that's a life bud of our democracy. But don't dehumanise to the lengths that some might…that then results in those atrocities.
And I do see good examples. I mean, this week, if I could use one short example, I met up with a Conservative councillor who posted on Facebook that she'd met with me and there was a post there that was less than flattering about me. She called it out. She blocked the person and she said she wouldn't tolerate it. Credit where it's due, that's the leader of Borders Council and I was really impressed.
Fiona Bruce
[00:50:19] Heather, what, if any, further protections? Because I mean, talking about changing culture is good and all very well, but that takes time.
Heather McGregor
[00:50:27] That does take time.

Fiona Bruce
[00:50:29] What can be done in the short to medium term?
Heather McGregor
[00:50:31] In the shorter time, I think that there will almost certainly have to be an approach by our members of parliament and our members of Scottish Parliament that triages things in the same way that GP surgeries do and there will have to be some element of screening. But what I would say is, this was a tragedy, it was a tragedy for Sir David, for his family, it was a tragedy for the people of Southend. We don't want an equivalent tragedy, which is that we let terrorism win by standing between our elected members of parliament and members of Scottish parliament and the people that they represent.
I'm represented in parliament by Christine Jardine, I am represented in the Scottish parliament by Gordon McDonald. I have never met either of them but I would like to think that if I wanted to I could. And the thought that that might not be possible I think is tremendously sad. We don't want to heap a tragedy on another tragedy.

Brian Cox
[00:51:29] I think there's a thing happening at the moment which I think we do have to protect our representatives, because they are our representatives and we need to make sure that they are safe, first and foremost. But this extraordinary man, who I didn't know, Sir David Amess, I mean, what comes across about his life was this was a man who was very ecumenical in his beliefs. He had great relationships with our Islamic brethren, for example, and this to me…and clearly this man was targeted. He was targeted because of that very reason, because he actually was across the divide.
Fiona Bruce
[00:52:12] I mean, we have no idea why he was killed, of course.
Brian Cox
[00:52:15] No, we don't know, but I just thought it was shocking. I mean, I saw this wonderful kind of…when a group of the Islamic brethren came along and we were talking about him and how much they respected this man and how wonderful this man was. And I just thought, now this is a good guy, this is one of the good guys.
Andrew Bowie
[00:52:32] He was, yeah.
Brian Cox
[00:52:34] And they're killing one of the good guys. That's what scared me.
Fiona Bruce
[00:52:37] Right, we have got about five minutes left and I want to get one question in very quickly so you'll have to be reasonably brief, if you would. Which is from Ashleigh Pany.

[00:52:44] Glasgow's refuse services have been severely impacted by the pandemic. Our city is currently littered with rubbish and rats. With COP26 coming, which I welcome, by the way, I just wonder, is this the right time to be showcasing our city?
Fiona Bruce
[00:52:59] What do you think?
Audience Member 20211028QT42
[00:53:01] I think that it could be embarrassing for the city.
Fiona Bruce
[00:53:04] Could be embarrassing?
Audience Member 20211028QT43
[00:53:06] Yeah.
Fiona Bruce
[00:53:06] Anas.
Anas Sarwar
[00:53:08] Well, we have our cleansing workers going on strike during COP26 because of the state of our streets and the cuts to cleansing services. We have our real workers going on strike because we're cutting routes here in Scotland at a time when we're trying to tell people to get out of cars and get into public transport. We had an announcement today that bus drivers in Glasgow are planning on going on strike during COP26. And this is a direct result of us saying one rhetoric on the international stage and the national stage and cutting local budgets for local people in our communities at the same time, which is completely and utterly unacceptable.

Anas Sarwar
[00:53:38] Glasgow is the greatest place in the world. I love the city of Glasgow, I was born here, brought up here, proud to represent it. We call ourselves the Dear Green Place, but this Dear Green Place is let down by cuts to local government, cuts to local budgets, and not supporting…
Fiona Bruce
[00:53:55] Okay, you're going to have to be brief, I'm sorry. I'm just going to take you back to the original question, which is, Glasgow's refuse services have been impacted by the pandemic. Our city is littered with rubbish and rats. It's great having COP26 at Glasgow. Is this how Glasgow should be portrayed on the world's stage? Kate, what would you say?
Kate Forbes
[00:54:09] Well, there is a lot of work to do and there's a lot of work being done right now with people out on a daily basis, ensuring that rubbish is collected, that the fly-tipping is cleared and that the graffiti is wiped off. Every single city is going to have to prepare…
Fiona Bruce
[00:54:24] Oh, just as you said that a whole raft of hands went up. Just very quickly, Anas, I've heard from you, if you'll forgive me. The man in the white shirt, but you'll have to be really quick.

[00:54:30] Okay. One of the things that I always think that the Scottish Government does is put a plaster over things. There will be funding put into this for about three weeks and then when everyone leaves, when this international event has ended, we'll come back to there's litter everywhere.
Fiona Bruce
[00:54:49] Okay, Heather. Sorry, you've literally got about 30 seconds. I'll give you 15 seconds. Go on.
Kate Forbes
[00:54:55] I mean, Glasgow has a proud heritage of hosting international events and showcasing the best of Glaswegian hospitality and welcoming people. I think that's what we should be celebrating.
Andrew Bowie
[00:55:05] Pay the workers so they don't go on strike.

Heather McGregor
[00:55:06] This is the most amazing city. This is the city where 300 years ago Adam Smith studied. And there was no rubbish collection in those days and it was still the best city in the world. The motto here in this city is let Glasgow flourish. I think Glasgow will flourish with COP26. Like you, I welcome it. I think it's going to be a great two weeks, rubbish or not.
Fiona Bruce
[00:55:27] Okay, Brian.
Brian Cox
[00:55:30] I think it's great that Glasgow is hosting COP26.

[00:55:32] And what about the point that you're making there about the issues with rubbish collection, the rats, fly-tipping, what have you?
Brian Cox
[00:55:39] I mean, that's life.
Fiona Bruce
[00:55:41] Okay, that's life. Andrew.
Andrew Bowie
[00:55:42] Well, I disagree slightly. I think for the people who are living in Glasgow, it shouldn't be life. I think that Glasgow City Council [inaudible 00:55:52]. We've seen Glasgow at its best. We saw in 2014 the amazing Go Glasgow that was demonstrated to the world through the Commonwealth Games and Aberdeen winning the league cup, and that's what we know Glasgow can be.

Andrew Bowie
[00:56:00] And I really hope that Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government can step up and get it back to where it was then. Because Glasgow deserves that. And we should be concentrating on what the negotiations that are being held behind closed doors and not on the fact that the litter is not being picked up around Glasgow.
Fiona Bruce
[00:56:24] Time to hear one more thing from the audience. Yes, the woman there with the long hair at the back.
Audience Member 20211028QT45
[00:56:29] It's just like for an event that's meant that to be about protecting the environment, having the place covered in rubbish, it kind of gives mixed messages, which is kind of what makes that embarrassing.
