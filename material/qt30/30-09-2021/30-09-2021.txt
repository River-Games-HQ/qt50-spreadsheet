[0:01:15] With energy prices and inflation increasing, is it fair to take 20 pounds a week away from the poorest in our society?
Fiona Bruce
[0:01:23] Anna, what's your view on this, since you asked the question?
AudienceMember 20210930QT02
[0:01:26] Well, I don't think it's fair, I work for the community and I see increased number of parents and families accessing the food banks and accessing the holiday lunches, and it's just getting worse, and it's a bit of a shame that sixth richest economy in the world, there's so many people who are struggling.

David Lammy
[0:01:51] It's brutally unfair, it's cruel, it's mean, it's nasty. If you're a carer and thank God for our carers in the last 18 months, or you're a nurse or you work in a prison and you've kept COVID from breaking out right across the prison, you're on 18 thousand pounds a year, that cut means 1100 a year that you now have to pay. It's actually the cost of the average energy bill, so this is a huge cost to my constituents and many millions of people across the country, and it's a choice, and it's coming alongside an increase of course in national insurance. Economists are predicting an inflation rise, and certainly interest rates going up by next February, so this is mean, it's nasty, it's unnecessary and there should have been a U turn.

Fiona Bruce
[0:02:51] so the cost of it, keeping the cost of it, David, would be about six billion pounds a year, so how would you suggest paying for that?
David Lammy
[0:03:00] We said that we would replace universal credit and we wouldn't do this. We've also said…
Fiona Bruce
[0:03:06] How would you pay for it? Whatever you replace it with, how are you going to find the money?
David Lammy
[0:03:08] We are some way before an election, we will cost that election, we will not be going into a general election with uncosted proposals.

[0:03:15] So you're just saying, don't know how we're going to pay for it, but we'll do it, folks.
David Lammy
[0:03:18] Now, I'm really clear, my job is to oppose this government, and particularly when it comes to the poorest people in our country and particularly for my constituents. All Labour members, all Labour MPs agree on that, this is not up for debate. We should not be cutting…
Fiona Bruce
[0:03:31] You still have to pay for it nonetheless.
David Lammy
[0:03:32] …universal credit by 20 pounds. I've said that we will cost the proposal when we get to the next general election, I guarantee it, Fiona.

Fiona Bruce
[0:03:39] Is it fair to take 20 pounds a week away from the poorest in society, Grant?
Grant Shapps
[0:03:43] First of all, we all want to make sure that everyone in society has money to get through the coronavirus and get back into jobs, and that's why we spent over 400 billion pounds on families, on individuals, on businesses throughout the coronavirus, and we knew that when we included the uplift in universal credit, we said it was for a temporary period. It was during coronavirus, in the same way that furlough, for example, is coming to an end this month, because that was during the coronavirus, and one of the good things that's happened is we see more people in employment now than before coronavirus. We see more job opportunities, more job openings than even before coronavirus, in fact ever now, and we've seen salaries increase.
7:37
Part 6
Words: 0
Fiona Bruce
[0:04:25] But people are now facing a perfect storm. The Bank of England's predicting inflation could rise above four per cent. As we all know now, because there's so much on the news about it, energy prices…our bills are going to go up, and you're taking money away as well, so the situation has changed.
Grant Shapps
[00:04:40] Also we've seen salaries go up actually by a bit more than four per cent, and this is not the only thing that we did for coronavirus, so for example, a local housing allowance is remaining, even though the increase was brought in for coronavirus. We've got children additions and allowances. We've expanded the working allowance. We've introduced healthy start vouchers and increased the amounts of money that goes for children costs being covered up from 70 to 80 per cent through the universal system. So we've done a whole lot of things, and your point to David was absolutely right, it's cost nine billion to run the increase in universal credit up to now, and it was introduced as a temporary measure. It would carry on being another six billion to carry on running. You have to then decide what to do. Do you carry on increasing other taxes that would be a penny on income tax, three or four p on say the cost of fuel, if you were to do that, that would increase the cost of living? So there are choices to make, and the government can't wait until the next election to have to make choices.

AudienceMember 20210930QT03
[0:05:43] Hi Grant. Do you still think it's acceptable that any British citizen should be visiting a food bank in the first place?
Fiona Bruce
[0:05:48] Grant, I'm going to get round the audience and I'll come back to you. Yes, the woman here in the middle with the glasses.
AudienceMember 20210930QT04
[0:05:53] So, for people like me who are chronically ill, how do you justify cutting the 20 pound a week for people that can't get back into work and things are rising like energy bills and rent?
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:04] So, just tell us a little bit about your situation then.
AudienceMember 20210930QT05
[0:06:07] So, I suffer with multiple chronic illnesses, so my conditions fluctuate a lot, so I struggle with work, especially full time work, so yeah.
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:18] So, that money would mean a lot to you.
AudienceMember 20210930QT06
[0:06:20] It does, yeah, definitely.
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:22] Well, I'm sorry to hear that about your illnesses. Yes, the lady here in the yellow cardi.

AudienceMember 20210930QT07
[0:06:25] So, you've mentioned quite a few initiatives that you're doing, but it's not working, people are still struggling and using food banks, so you need to revisit it and do more. If it was a large corporation or someone who was well of, you would care, it just seems like you don't care about people who are poor and struggling. That's what it seems like, it seems like the government doesn't care.
Fiona Bruce
[0:06:46] Do you want to reply to that, I mean, because the thing is, you certainly have listed a whole load of initiatives, but you hear people say, well, so what? The fact it, it doesn't feel like that to us.
Grant Shapps
[0:06:54] Yeah, look, first of all, the number of people in absolutely poverty I'm pleased to say has been falling and has continued to fall, and that's because we've done things for people who are in work, for example, the national living wage, which didn't even exist when we came into power, that's actually increased people's salary at the lower end by four thousand pounds a year. It was not even a thing. Now, I understand about the points that the lady was saying about not being in work and therefore the other benefits which would need to be there to help provide help and support.

Grant Shapps
[0:07:20]
Of course, we all want to help people in society. I mean, I actually accept, by the way, that everybody, the other politicians on this panel want to do the same thing as well, of course we do. This was introduced for a specific purpose over the coronavirus. We're coming to the end of that in the same way as we're coming to the end of furlough. If we want to carry on doing things, we have to be able to pay for those things as well, and as I say, we boosted up other benefits in order to help people through what's been a difficult period.
Fiona Bruce
[0:07:51] Okay, Kate.
Kate Andrews
[0:07:53] Yeah, it does feel like there's something intrinsically unfair about this, like it's a cliff edge for those who are most vulnerable, but who are also trying to work, trying to earn an income, and just not quite getting there. As Grant says, we are in dangerous territory if emergency measures from COVID get rolled over into normal public policy without a debate, without a discussion about it. The government was very generous and spent a lot of money on paying people's wages through furlough, of increase welfare, now we have to separate that policy from the pandemic and have a proper discussion about if we want to prioritise this, how far up the priority list is it, how are we going to fund it, and what are we poten…what resources might be move around to do that? Now, David said his job is to oppose the government. I do wonder about that.

David Lammy
[0:08:40] When it comes to the poorest, I'm really clear, that's what I said.
Kate Andrews
[0:08:42] Well, I wonder about that, David, because when it comes to the poorest, I wonder if maybe there's an opportunity here for Conservative and Labour to come together and at least find a temporary solution to this issue. One of them could be that we need to lower the taper for universal credit. Rather than giving a 20 pound handout a week, we can lower the taper from 63p to 50p so that work really is paying more and more, so that when you're going to work, when you're coming home, you get to keep more of that benefit in the first place, and then maybe the Conservatives and Labour could come together and figure out where they're going to find that six billion pounds, as Grant says. Are you going to put a penny on income tax? Are you going to divert the tax that we're now going to be raising for health and social care, are you going to divert half of that? These are tough questions that we have to start answering, but perhaps we can actually care about those who are struggling the most at the bottom and come together on this one, at least for a temporary period of time, to figure out how we could solve this, and try to avoid that cliff edge, maybe even using the system as it exists now to change that taper.

[0:09:40] Richard.
Richard Walker
[0:09:42] No, Anna, I don't think it's right. We…I always look at this through the sort of lens of our customers, and we have a thousand shops around the UK, five million customers a week, and many of those are from the poorest communities in the UK. Some of our customers may rely on benefits to feed their families, some of our customers might only have 25 quid a week to spend on food, so in that context, you sort of understand how this removal of the 20 pound credit will affect them. Of course, at the other end of the equation, this is coming just at the wrong time.
Now, I think any voter would expect their government to be fiscally prudent, but this is going to come at a time where we will see food inflation in the market – maybe we'll talk about that later – and obviously there's been a lot in the news about the rising gas prices and energy prices, so for some people, this is a choice between heating and eating, it really is that serious. The gentleman mentioned the alarming rise in food banks, there's now more food banks than branches of McDonalds in this country. We're a G7 country, how can that be right? So no, I think this is the wrong timing and I don't think it's fair.

Fiona Bruce
[0:11:10] The man there.
Male Aud 2
[0:11:11] Do we not think that we're blaming COVID and COVID is just showing the cracks in a system that was already there and wasn't working?
Fiona Bruce
[0:11:23] Munira, we haven't heard you on this question.
Munira Wilson
[0:11:26] Do I think it's fair, Anna, that…
Fiona Bruce
[0:11:29] And are we just blaming COVID, as the man says?
Munira Wilson
[0:11:32] Well, we already had a problem before COVID, I agree, and there was already a record food bank usage before the pandemic, but do I think it's fair on the single mum in my constituency who contacted me, who said, I won't be able to take my daughter swimming on occasion, is that a luxury? Is that a treat to be able to give your child the occasional bit of physical exercise?

Munira Wilson
[0:11:52] Do I think it's fair on the disabled woman who contacted me, who said, I'm being told by the Conservative government, just go out and work more hours, like this young lady said in the audience, she said, I desperately want to work, but I can't because of my physical and mental health conditions, how am I going to get by, as others have said, we've seen energy prices going up, food prices are already going through the roof, and many of these people, because a lot of people on universal credit are working, will also be hit by the national insurance rise that's coming in in April next year.
I mean, the average nurse in the NHS is going to be paying 315 pounds more in her tax, so no, I don't think it's fair. I think it needs to be maintained, I think it's cruel and it's callous, and I think Grant knows that, because there've been plenty of his own backbenchers who have also been saying that it needs to be kept, so when Kate says we need a debate, actually we've had quite a lot of debates, and there are people in all the parties across the House of Commons who are saying, you have to maintain this, otherwise we are going to be plunging people into destitution and poverty, and as somebody in the audience said, in a G7 country, it is utterly unacceptable.

AudienceMember 20210930QT08
[0:13:17] I would say the government developed a reputation for being quite compassionate in its approach during the coronavirus pandemic, and I'm surprised now at the fact that the government is shooting itself in the foot really on this particular issue. When you responded to the question about what the government was doing, Mr Shapps, you gave a very complicated answer that there were other measures in place. I would counsel the government to reconsider this measure. It's beholden on us in society to look after those who are in difficulty, like the lady who spoke earlier, and I don't think that the current policy is addressing that.
Fiona Bruce
[0:14:05] David.
David Lammy
[0:14:06] Can I just say, it's important to understand that 25 per cent of young people in our country are living in poverty. Child poverty is soaring across Britain, and this is a choice. When this government was asked to act on free school meals, it took a footballer to get the government to act. When this government was asked to have sufficient funds so that children in state schools particularly who'd fallen backwards, the government couldn't find the money,

David Lammy
[0:14:36]
When given a choice, the government is always choosing not to side with the poorest in society. I remember it wasn't that long ago that the Conservatives were described as the nasty party. Grant, you can stare at your notes as much as you like, you're not going to find the answers. This cut should not be being made, it's as simple as that.
Fiona Bruce
[0:15:03] Grant.
Grant Shapps
[0:15:08] So, look, you say you would do all of these things, but the effective tax raise on people under the system for universal credit was 90 per cent, there were cliff edges for people working 16, 24 and 30 hours, so you know, it's not like the system's been perfect in the past. What we've done…hold on, I didn't…
David Lammy
[0:15:30] The food banks we have today are nothing like what we had in the past, you know that.
Grant Shapps
[0:15:35] Well, in part, that's because you banned the Job Centre Plus for even signalling…signposting it to people, but the…
David Lammy
[0:15:41] It's banal to suggest that, you know that.
7:48
Part 16
Words: 0
Grant Shapps
[0:15:42] Sorry, look, we have to work on the facts here, and the facts are that we need to pay for whatever it is that we do provide. The universal credit system is working vastly better than the system that it replaced and actually handled the coronavirus increase in the number of people who required assistance very well. I hear what Munira and others say about the trap that people find themselves in, and Munira actually mentions that people would end up having to pay one per cent extra on their national insurance, and perhaps I wasn't clear. Six billion a year is the equivalent of not just one penny on income tax, it's a penny on income tax plus three pence on fuel duty, so if you wanted to do that all through income tax, people would have even more money to pay in income tax.
And as I was mentioning before, the 20 pounds a week is one part of a much…and the gentleman said it all sounded very complicated, tax and the way that the system works just is, I'm afraid, but it is the case, as I mentioned, that the national living wage has already increased by four thousand pounds the amount people are getting, some of which didn't exist before doubling. Doubling the tax threshold, the amount people could earn from six and a half thousand to 12 and a half thousand, that's allowed people a lot more tax free earnings, so you do, I'm afraid, have to look at the overall amount…

Fiona Bruce
[0:17:01] Okay.
Grant Shapps
[0:17:02] …and the COVID support, 407 billion pounds so far, I think everyone appreciates that we have to pay for it somehow, and it can't go on ad infinitum as we move out of this period.
Fiona Bruce
[0:17:13] Alright, I'm going to move on, take another question, but before I do, I just want to tell you that next week we'll be in Birmingham, with Wes Streeting from Labour, and the former inhabitee of Love Island, Amy Hart. The following week, which is the 7th October, we'll be in Aldershot and comedian Rosie Jones will be on the panel, so if you live in either Birmingham or Aldershot, I cannot tell you how exciting it is to be doing a shout out for an audience, we haven't done it for a year and a half. If you live there or in the surrounding area, do come along and join us. You can go to the Question Time website and be part of the audience and we would love to hear from you.

AudienceMember 20210930QT09
[0:17:50] What should the UK do to fill the estimated 100 thousand HGV vacancies and avoid empty shelves this Christmas.
Fiona Bruce
[0:17:59] Well, Richard, I think you're probably the best qualified to take us through this to begin with.
Richard Walker
[0:18:05] I don't know. Yes, HGV drivers, right, well, we as a company are about 100 short, as a nation we're about 100 thousand short, and we have a long term structural issue in this country in that we have an ageing population of HGV drivers around the average age of 57, so we desperately need to recruit new drivers, and of course that's the right things to do.
Fiona Bruce
[0:18:36] And is the prospect of empty shelves or fewer things on shelves solely because of HGV drivers or are there other issues as well?
Richard Walker
[0:18:42] No, I mean, it's coming at us from all angles at the moment. We have the C02 issue, we have HGV, we have a shortage of workers in factories and fields and processing plants. It's very difficult out there, and my staff have been nothing short of heroic, as have the HGV drivers in terms of keeping the wheels turning over the last 18 months, throughout the pandemic. We haven't closed a single store, we haven't missed a single delivery, but now we're having to do so, and we're missing up to 80 deliveries a day to our stores. This is a real issue that is now impacting the supply into our stores.

[0:19:23] And what about Christmas then? I know you…I say I know, I imagine you will want to be careful in terms of not panicking everybody.
Richard Walker
[0:19:31] Yes, yeah.
Fiona Bruce
[0:19:32] But as candid as you can be with us, here you are on Question Time, what are the shelves going to look like at Christmas?
Richard Walker
[0:19:39] Well, I think we all have a responsibility to play…you know, the media does not need to sensationalise this.
Fiona Bruce
[0:19:44] No, no, that's why I'm asking you.
Richard Walker
[0:19:44] [voices overlap 19:44] do not need to encourage any panic buying, and we are fully stocked. We have full availability at the moment.
Fiona Bruce
[0:19:53] So, when the head of Tesco says, there will be some things that will not be available at Christmas.
Richard Walker
[0:19:57] Yeah, well, we're different, you know, we specialise in frozen, which has…
Fiona Bruce
[0:20:00] Sure.
7:52
Part 20
Words: 0
Richard Walker
[0:20:00] …longer lead times, so I'm perhaps more confident in them, but I do think it's an issue and it's an issue that if it's not sorted, will get worse very quickly, because we are stock building now for Christmas, which is the peak time of year, and our deliveries are going down at exactly the wrong time when they need to go up. Now, potentially one of the benefits of Brexit was that we will see wage inflation domestically, and we're now giving double digit wage increases to our HGV drivers, which is a good thing, and that'll cost us money, but it's the right thing to do. However, recruiting and training those HGV drivers will take six to nine months, and before then we have Christmas, so I think the solution, even if it's temporary, is very, very simple. Let's get HGV drivers onto the skilled worker list, which incidentally includes ballerinas and concert orchestra musicians, but it does…
Fiona Bruce
[0:20:55] And just to explain, so that means they can come over from the EU and work here in a perfectly straightforward fashion.

Richard Walker
[0:20:57] Exactly. Exactly right. Now, I know Europe has its own issues with HGV drivers, but of course it's a bigger pool to fish from, and I think that will ease potentially the issue that I'm really quite worried about, as we start to run into Christmas, and also have to deal with all of the issues…other issues that we're currently facing as an industry.
Fiona Bruce
[0:21:08] Munira.
Munira Wilson
[0:21:20] Well, I agree with a lot of what Richard said, and let's hope and pray we're not facing shortages this Christmas, but talking to some leaders in the industry this week, I understand that we are likely to have far less choice, and given the pressures because of the C02 shortage, the HGV driver crisis, we are already seeing prices going up, and as we've just been talking about, there are many families that are really going to struggle to make ends meet this Christmas.
7:54
Part 22

Fiona Bruce
[0:21:49] So what should the government be doing?
Munira Wilson
[0:21:50] So I agree that there should be…they should be looking at a visa solution to be able to bring in migrant workers. It's clear that with the immigration changes I think with COVID, lots of European drivers went home, and they haven't come back again, so putting in place a visa route for them to be able to come back, I think is important, but there are also long term changes in the labour market, as I think Richard alluded to, and we know some of the tax changes around self-employment, for instance, and the demographic changes in that workforce are meaning that this is not a short term problem, and what we need to see for a just in time supply chain is some long term planning, but unfortunately we've got a just in time government that tends to lurch from crisis to crisis.
We need to do some proper contingency planning around our workforce. This isn't just about HGV drivers, we're seeing shortages in our farms, in picking and packing food, as well as getting it onto supermarket shelves. And we know that it might not be the case for Iceland, but for some other supermarkets, we know there's been about a drop in a quarter of the fulfilment of their deliveries on their shelves, and that will mean that probably we'll all have far less choice this Christmas.

[0:23:25] Thank you. You hear a lot of stories from lorry drivers who are leaving, saying that basically it's not fun anymore. Their working conditions have deteriorated over the last 20 years whereby there are far fewer places for them to go, they're restricted access areas, they are monitored in their cabs by cameras, they are penalised for being late. In the olden days, they used to be able to take their wives with them, now, you know, that's not allowed for insurance and things like that, and people are just finding it a really…it's being put in a way that makes their working conditions much harder for them and much more unenjoyable, so that's another reason why they're leaving.

AudienceMember 20210930QT13
[0:24:05] Yeah, I understand that the government need to recruit more HGV drivers, but I'm really concerned that they seem to be making the licences easier to get, in particular you don't need to have a car licence now, you can immediately apply for an HGV licence, which to me just seems like an accident waiting to happen on the road.
Fiona Bruce
[0:24:22] So you think they're making it too easy.

[0:24:24] That's what I've heard, yes.
Fiona Bruce
[0:24:25] I mean, Grant, when you hear what Richard says, and lots of industry bosses in the supermarket supply chain have been saying, just give low skilled worker visas to the HGV drivers, at least in all the things that are going, you know, wrong at the moment, that's one thing you could sort out, why don't you just do it?
Grant Shapps
[0:24:43] Yeah, look, if that was actually the solution, I'm sure we'd move to it very quickly, and I don't rule out anything, but the…

[0:24:50] I understand, but I mean, this is my subject area, I've been working on it for the last two and a half years, and it's not something that we're suddenly doing just in time, in fact, I worked on a road to logistics programme with the haulage sector as one of the very first things that I introduced. This is a global problem, it has come directly as a consequence of coronavirus, and in particular we had to close all of the testing for HGV drivers at the DVSA, the testing centres throughout the…most of the crisis, and that's led to a specific bottleneck, which is very hard for people to…it was very hard for people to get their licences of course, because they were closed, and there's an attrition rate for a lot of the reasons that people have mentioned.
Fiona Bruce
[0:25:29] Sure, but Richard is saying, as someone whose profession this is, if you introduce low skilled working visas for HGV drivers, it would at least solve part of the problem that we have, so why don't you do that?

[0:25:37] Look, if I thought it would, I would do it. We already have six million Europeans with settled and pre-settled status, but if you go to Europe, Poland, 123 thousand shortage, Germany, 60 thousand shortage, the bottleneck is actually people getting tested, and also bringing people back into the market, and for some of the reasons that have been mentioned, Richard and other people have mentioned it, this is a market in which 99 per cent of lorry drivers are white male, average age 55 to 57, and it's because the conditions haven't been pleasant, but it's also because the pay hasn't been commensurate with the job being convenient, the long hours or the nights sleeping in the cab and things like that, and the conditions at truck stops.
And these are things that we can do something about, and a higher salary is something that we are happy to see. We don't think people…we think people should be able to work a hard day's work and get paid a proper wage for it. This is something which will correct the systemic problem which has led to shortages for a long time, because it has been constantly undercut by people coming in who are prepared to do the work.
Richard Walker
[0:26:38] That will take time. I'm worried about Christmas before then.

Richard Walker
[0:26:42] So you think not adding them to the skilled worker list would make no difference whatsoever?
Grant Shapps
[0:26:44] Well, no, what I'm saying is, the decision here is whether it would actually make any difference to do so by Christmas. What I can tell you is I've already taken a series of measures. The gentleman up there mentioned about safety when it comes to testing. Bit of confusion in that, that's not the case. The tests are no easier, what we've done is to bring two parts of the test, articulated and rigid lorry tests together into one test [voices overlap 27:08] technical changes to open up more spaces.
Fiona Bruce
[0:27:07] The thing is, if you've been thinking about this for two and a half years, why have you only just done it?
Grant Shapps
[0:27:11] No, we haven't, we already consulted on it, so we were ready to go with that, I've opened up tests. The main problem though is the tests couldn't be run because of coronavirus, which is not something anyone could…

Richard Walker
[0:27:20] But we now can't get any tests until December in the south of England.
Grant Shapps
[0:27:23] No, that is a thing which we're improving, because there are more tests becoming available.
Richard Walker
[0:27:26] So that's not going to help Christmas.
Fiona Bruce
[0:27:28] Please, Grant, you keep talking and Richard keeps saying it's not going to help Christmas, and we're all sitting here thinking, what about Christmas?
Grant Shapps
[0:27:35] Yeah, so let me just sort of set out…
Fiona Bruce
[0:27:37] Very briefly, because you [voices overlap 27:39]
Grant Shapps
[0:27:40] We've already added 50 per cent to the number of tests that are available compared with pre-coronavirus. A couple of weeks ago after a consultation and going through all the processes and changing some of the testing regime, doesn't make it any less safer, it simply means tests can be combined and done in a slightly different way. We'll have another 50 thousand tests available, and these are all coming in prior to Christmas, so these are things, measures that will resolve the issues in the lead up to Christmas.
Richard Walker

Grant Walker

[0:28:17] What we're looking at is a winter of discontent, that's what we're looking at. We have shortages of staff, shortages of supplies and shortages of skills. How…why has this happened? It's largely happened, because the promises that your party made on Brexit, which have not been delivered. Where is the trade deal with the United States? Where is the trade deal with India? They haven't got one. Why haven't you invested in further education? Where are the [inaudible 0:28:41] schools, what have you done about it? Of course, we need to get on with the visas so that these people can come in, and it's not just HGV…
Grant Shapps
[0:28:49] So to be clear…
David Lammy
[0:28:49] …it's fruit pickers, it's caterers, it's people in concert halls, right across this country, there are shortages. You promised that immigration would come down, and you know that it will need to go up if we're to deal with these problems.

[0:29:04] So we've been talking a lot about the delivery issues. I'm a store manager in retail and have been for a number of years, and it's incredibly difficult at the moment for store teams in and outside of the buildings. Last Christmas was really challenging with the lockdowns opening and closing. This year already we're facing difficulties getting products on the shelves. Isn't it about time that for all retailers, to allow their teams to have time off on Boxing Day for the first time, I just think that really should just be a thing for all retailers. I know some big names have already kind of announced it, but surely you guys on the panel can do something about that to allow us to spend some time with our friends and our family after working such an intense period through Christmas.
Fiona Bruce
[0:29:50] And are you kind of of…are you reassured by what you're hearing in terms of what you're hearing from the government in terms of sorting out the issues of…

Fiona Bruce
[0:30:00] Are you reassured by what you're hearing in terms of sorting out the issues of delivery?
AudienceMember 20210930QT17
[0:30:03] Not overly, because we've been seeing like delivery issues for quite a while now, as have our customers, and you can only keep saying the same thing to them over and over, so I really think that the government need to get a grip on this and just make it easier, because it's already tough as it is out on the high street.

[0:30:19] I just want to say thank you as well. I mean, you haven't had the option to work from home, unlike most industries, and you're right, it's a very tough job which is getting tougher.
Fiona Bruce
[0:30:27] And would you like to see them get Boxing Day off, your own workers?
Richard Walker
[0:30:30] Yes, yes, I would, yeah.
Fiona Bruce
[0:30:32] Right, if anyone from Iceland is watching, they heard it here. Kate.

Richard Walker
[0:30:41] I'd better say it now, yes, we are, yeah.
Fiona Bruce
[0:30:44] There we are. Kate.
Kate Andrews
[0:30:51] If you want to get thousands more HGV drivers on the road, you raise wages, you improve their working conditions. If you want workers such as yourself to stay in the job and not to look for one of the million job vacancies that now exist in the UK to go elsewhere to improve their conditions, then you need to do so. Workers in many ways at the moment are becoming the new bosses.

Kate Andrews
[0:31:21]
They can ask for a lot more than they could before. Average wages have skyrocketed. The shortages, the flipside of it, there are lots of problems with it, but the flipside of it is that wages are going up, workers who got us through the pandemic, the people who couldn't stay home, who were in the shops, who were delivering the packages, who were driving on the road, they are about to be valued.
They are about to be valued so much more than they were the decade before when they were struggling for stagnant wages, and I am really torn on this one, because as somebody who was very supportive of Brexit and thinks has a lot of opportunity, I was also devastated to see free movement go. I've always been a big advocate of free movement, but if there is a benefit to what has happened is that native workers are about to get that big pay raise, and they so, so deserve it, and I think Grant's right that even if you added lorry drivers to the skilled working list, the shortage is across Europe now. It is not at all obvious that we solve the problem overnight. Workers are now empowered to ask for more money. They should do, they should ask for better working conditions. This is their moment, in terms of winners and losers, and there are always are, is the workers who got us through the pandemic that are about, I think, to have some real winnings come their way, and I'm excited to see it.

[0:32:28] Okay. We've got another question from Katrin Bass.
AudienceMember 20210930QT18
[0:32:33] Hi. Do you agree that the police should have extra powers to remove climate change protectors?
Fiona Bruce
[0:32:41] Protestors, so…
AudienceMember 20210930QT19
[0:32:42] Yes, thank you.
Fiona Bruce
[0:32:42] So obviously we've seen these protests on the M25, the government's now taken out an injunction, but what do you think, Katrin?
AudienceMember 20210930QT20
[0:32:48] Well, so I'm a self-employed florist, I work for myself, obviously, and I was thinking about that, I was listening to the Jeremy Vine show as I do every day, and they were talking about, and I was quite upset in a way, because if you're stuck there, like in my case, for example, if I have a coffin spray in the back of my delivery van and I can't get to that funeral because the road is blocked, then that's not very nice for these people, especially I've worked all through the pandemic as well by myself, because I got the flowers direct delivered from Holland, so that was actually possible to do that, I didn't have to go to the wholesalers, so they stuck it in my home garage where I worked behind closed doors. So I done loads and loads and loads of funerals, and then so to have to deal with, that hardly anyone could go to the funerals, that was really hard for me as well.

Fiona Bruce
[0:33:43] And do you think the police should have extra powers to stop the M25 protestors?
AudienceMember 20210930QT21
[0:33:47] Well, I think they should do more about it, you know, I've listened so much to the radio the last 18, 22 months, and yeah, sometimes my heart is just going a bit crazy about things. Also if you're for example a mother with a baby in the back, and then you're stuck for five hours there, maybe your bottle runs out, so…
Fiona Bruce
[0:34:10] What are you going to do, yes, exactly. Can I just ask, does anyone here support what the protestors are doing on the M25 and think it might be inconvenient, but actually it's the right thing to do, you've got your hand up there.
AudienceMember 20210930QT22
[0:34:22] It's inconvenient and it's not the best way, but if the government did something about things, they wouldn't have to take those actions, so if…do something and then they'll stop.
Fiona Bruce
[0:34:33] The man at the back in the grey top.
AudienceMember 20210930QT23
[0:34:36] Yeah, I agree with the lady, there wouldn't be a problem if the government did something about climate change, instead of claiming to be, you know, the leader of the world in climate change, why don't we actually do something about it instead of just claiming.
8:07
Part 35
Words: 0
Fiona Bruce
[0:34:49] Okay, well listen, let's come back to the question. Do you agree the police should have extra powers to remove climate change protestors, so Grant, you have just managed to give the police extra powers, because you've got a temporary injunction to stop the protestors protesting on the M25 itself, nowhere else, is that enough? Are you going to go further? Are you happy with that?
Grant Shapps
[0:35:08] Look, I am actually completely with the lady who asked the question. It is completely irresponsible, it is totally dangerous to walk onto a motorway. They're putting their own lives and the lives of people on the motorway at risk. It's counterproductive, because the traffic stands there causing the pollution they claim they care about, in the homes which turn out not to be insulated, and I cannot imagine why on earth anyone would think it was a good idea to step onto a motorway like that. That's why I asked National Highways, who run our motorways, to get hold of an injunction, which they did the other night. That injunction is now in place, but the reality is, that if we want to solve climate change, that is something that this government is passionate about doing. We're moving towards electric vehicles, we've got a transport decarbonisation, a plan for it, which no other country in the world has got. We've been decarbonising faster than any other country in the G7.

[0:36:04] I mean, the committee on climate change says you are not on track to meet your net zero target by 2050 and your policies have yet…or your ten point plan is yet to be backed by firm policies.
Grant Shapps
[0:36:15] The committee on climate change I think I'm right in saying made that before we set the latest carbon budget, gets very technical, called CB6, which puts us on…if we achieve, of course, will put us on track to do it, but you know, perfectly legitimate for people to protest. We have an open democracy where people should be able to do that, but walking onto a motorway, putting their lives and others and the emergency services at risk, it's completely out of order, and that's why I stepped in to stop it.
Fiona Bruce
[0:36:48] David, will you be comfortable if some of these protestors go to prison?
David Lammy
[0:36:51] Yes, because I support the right to protest, absolutely, I don't support the government in some of the changes that they've made to protests, but you have to protest within the law. I think there was a woman who ended up with some paralysis this week because she couldn't get to hospital, and that underlies the problem. So I think the High Court were right in their decision.

[0:37:00]
The powers I think are there, I'm not sure the police are asking for further powers, so yes, people should protest, and yes, there's room also for civil disobedience, but I think some of what we've seen is actually not commanding the support of the public.
Fiona Bruce
[0:37:33] And these powers are temporary…
David Lammy
[0:37:33] And the whole point of protest is to command the support of the public and that's clearly not happening.
Fiona Bruce
[0:37:38] And these powers are temporary, would you like to see them permanently?
David Lammy
[0:37:41] I think the police are not asking for more powers, so the powers are there and I think the High Court's decision sends a powerful signal to both the protestors and the police about what's expected.
Fiona Bruce
[0:37:54] Man there in the pale blue shirt, yes.
AudienceMember 20210930QT24

Fiona Bruce
[0:38:43] The man here.
AudienceMember 20210930QT26
[0:38:45] I don't think that blocking a road is the right way to go about things, but I do think that the more restrictions you put on people's rights to protest, the more of a sort of state we're becoming where if you want to speak out, if you want to make your feelings heard, you're just put down straightaway, you're put in an extremist column, and you just…you can't say what you truly believe.
Fiona Bruce

[0:39:10] Two things, one, I look at the different…not the ones on the M25, but before, and I get the impression that the police don't seem to have control of it, whether they're too soft, whether there's not enough of them, they must have the intel to prepare for this. The second thing, if it were me, and I'm not a politician, I'd take one of them HGV lorries where they're sitting, I'd arrest them, put them in that wagon, and send them to the top of Scotland, make their own back and stop them from bleeding doing it, because it just…
Fiona Bruce
[0:39:50] I wonder how Scotland would feel about that?
AudienceMember 20210930QT29
[0:39:52] Well, it might…but the thing for me is, they're right in what they're doing as in…
Fiona Bruce
[0:40:00] In the principle, you think.
AudienceMember 20210930QT30
[0:40:01] Yeah, they're right in that, but the way that they're doing it just really making people's days really bad and horrible, and they shouldn't be doing that, because if they want support, they'd better take us with them, and if they don't, they're going to be like they are now. Most of us agree with what they're about, but not the way they're doing it, and they'll lost that support, and then in the end, it'll have been for nothing.

Fiona Bruce
[0:40:47] Kate.
Kate Andrews
[0:40:48] I'm always sceptical to give the police more powers and we don't need to in the circumstances, it's already an offence to obstruct a highway, so I don't think that's a necessary thing to do. I think the police have a tough job at the moment in figuring out how to facilitate this, but the reality is, if you form a protective circle around people sitting in the middle of the motorway, they're going to keep sitting there, and there's a reason we don't go sit in the middle of motorways, I mean, not that that's how many of us would want to spend our time anyway, but I think there does need to be a really hard line on this.

I completely agree with the right to protest and protecting those very sacred rights, but this isn't normal protest, this is just absolute destruction and chaos, and it is jeopardising people's lives in the back of ambulances. It's putting people in a terrible situation.
And I think David hit the nail on the head when he said it's about swaying hearts and minds. We're in a great position in the UK where if you look at the major parties, you might not like all their policies by any means, but their voting base is in agreement that we want to make this a greener world, that we want to tackle climate change, but you're not winning people over and you're not helping the cause when you just ruin someone's day or actually put somebody in danger. So this needs to be cracked down on and quite quickly.
Fiona Bruce
[0:41:59] Munira.
Munira Wilson
[0:42:01] Let me be very clear, they have gone about campaigning on climate change in absolutely the wrong way, and are putting the cause back by the danger that they are creating, causing.

8:15
Part 42
Words: 0
Munira Wilson
[0:42:19] Absolutely, but I think it's important to say, I don't agree with the means at all. The cause I do agree with, and I mean, Grant says, you know, we're a leader in climate change policies. I mean, these people are campaigning to insulate Britain. When the Liberal Democrats were in government between 2010 and 2015, we had a zero carbon home standard which was got rid of once the Tories were on their own, not a single zero carbon home has been built since then. We had an obligation on energy companies to pay for and support insulation of homes, that was scrapped, okay, so we need…the reason why energy bills are going up, apart from the fact that global prices have gone up is because our homes are not insulated very well at all, and therefore if we want to cut fuel poverty, if we want to cut bills, if we want to cut emissions, we need to have an emergency insulation programme. So I absolutely agree with their aims, but I don't agree with the means, and I think we've seen this week actually that the police have all the powers they need to deal with them.
Grant Shapps
[0:43:29] No, I'm saying the opposite.
8:16
Part 43

Munira Wilson
[0:43:31] And…no, but you went to the High Court, you got the injunction straightaway, and through the injunction you were able to take action. You don't need to go further as you are legislatively where you're going to be cracking down on very peaceful protest, quite often against this government. It's really sinister.
Fiona Bruce
[0:43:48] So you're talking about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.
Munira Wilson
[0:43:50] That's right.
Fiona Bruce
[0:43:51] Richard
Richard Walker
[0:43:52] Well, you know, I think any rational person would agree with their cause, and any rational person would disagree with their methods which are dangerous and idiotic and disrupt people's lives, and as David referenced, it has destroyed one lady's life as well. The whole environmental debate needs reframing, not to focus on cost and compromise, but it needs to…we need to talk about jobs and opportunity. Now, with regards to the insulation elements, absolutely, you know, that is a clear thing that we can, must and should do, but I believe the government fully agree with that, and they'd like to insulate homes by 2035, but there's 20 million households in the UK, and it'll cost an average about a thousand pounds to do so per household, so that's a lot of dough. So what we need now is to see a proper well though through robust plan, in terms of how we're actually going to scale this up as quickly as possible.
8:17
Part 44
Words: 0
Kate Andrews
[0:44:48] I'm not sure any rational person would agree with every single one of their claims. They come up with some pretty extreme stuff that isn't necessarily backed by the scientific community, and on top of that, let's point out another reason that energy bills are going up, it's because renewables, wind and solar, this past month, this past few months haven't been as reliable as they have been in the past. It hasn't been as windy, we haven't had as much sun. Now, as somebody who would love to be able to move to a completely renewable system, who doesn't want a greener world, we're being a bit dishonest with ourselves about where we're actually at and what we can achieve. The only way we get to net zero by 2050, the only way we do this properly is if we bring people with us, and we need to be honest about the fact that we have been focused on decarbonisation quite rightly, but the UK more so than a lot of other European countries has undermined its own energy security. We had far less gas reserve in the UK than Germany or France or Italy did, we're in a real bind now, so we need to have this honest conservation, and we might applaud their end goal, but I don't think it's fair to say that any rational person thinks that we should just adopt their policies overnight, whether they sit on the M25 or not. It's that dishonesty that's partially gotten us into this energy crisis to begin with.

[0:46:12] But if you speak to the people on the M25, they may not like your nuanced answer, if my point.
Richard Walker
[0:46:14] …why aren't we world leading in those? There's a whole load of other stuff, hydrogen, you know, we're already…
Kate Andrews
[0:46:18] Yeah, nuclear.
Richard Walker
[0:46:19] …we have amazing R and D, we need to scale that up. Let's talk about micro nuclear, there's all sorts of things we should be scaling up.
Kate Andrews
[0:46:22] Speak to people on the M25 and they might not agree with your relatively nuanced position on this, that's what I'm saying.
Grant Shapps
[0:46:27] Slightly off the actual question which was about whether it was right for people to go on the M25 rather than the power supply, but both the other politicians on the panel have mentioned the police already having the powers. That was evidently not the case when the same people who were protesting on the first day were out on the third day and then on the fifth day, having been arrested each time in between. The reason I had to take an injunction was it was the only way to make that contempt of court and therefore imprisonable, and supporting the Police and Crime Bill would actually hope folks, but neither of these guys are doing that.

[0:47:32] Sarah, I want to just start by saying that our GPs have done a phenomenal job throughout this pandemic. They've worked incredibly hard.

Fiona Bruce
[0:47:54] Okay, but the question is, Munira, how can GP practices be supported to provide quality care for patients so that we can see them face to face, I think that's what you're getting at, Sarah.
Munira Wilson
[0:48:02] Well, I think as we start to roll out the booster programme, booster jab programme for instance, I think we should be relying much more on community pharmacy, for instance, and some of the vaccination hubs in my constituency, the big vaccination hub has been shut down.
Fiona Bruce
[0:48:14] No, no, the question is about seeing GPs face to face, not going to your pharmacy.
Munira Wilson
[0:48:17] No, no, but the point I'm making is that if there is less pressure on GPs from other things such as the vaccination programme, they will be freed up a bit more to see people face to face. We need investment in our GP surgeries, we need to recruit and train far more GPs. There's huge workforce pressures across the NHS, GPs being one of them, so it's about that long term investment. In the short term, it's trying to find ways to free them so that they can see you face to face, and don't forget there are people who actually prefer the remote triage, so where people are happy to be seen remotely, that's probably a quicker way to be seen, then that frees up time for people to be able to see others face to face.

[0:48:57] Okay. Let me just put this in context. I'm not entirely sure that vaccinations is the issue, as far as I'm aware, most vaccinations happen outside GP surgeries, but the Royal College…the head of the Royal College of GPs has been addressing this issue, it was pre-pandemic that 80 per cent of appointments were carried out face to face with GPs, it's now something like 57 per cent, and the head of the Royal College of GPs says he thinks 56 per cent is about right, so you then have the prime minister saying people actually should be able to see their GP face to face if they want to. So you've asked this question. Is this because you're involved, you're a GP, or you've got a personal interest?
AudienceMember 20210930QT33
[0:49:32] Just a patient, and I understand the pressures on the system, it's just what can we do, what can we do to help?
Fiona Bruce
[0:49:38] And do you want to be able to see your GP face to face when you want?
AudienceMember 20210930QT34
[0:49:40] Ideally yes, yes, ideally.

Fiona Bruce
[0:49:45] So 56 per cent is about right, that's what the head of the Royal College is saying. Richard, does that sound right to you?
Richard Walker
[0:49:51] Well, you know, speaking as a patient at times myself, and I…we referenced earlier in the show that my frontline colleagues haven't had the option of being able to work from home. It doesn't feel to me as a patient right, really quite nervous, about the lack of face to face contacts with GPs, and therefore missing the nuances, you know, the small things that potentially you can only get from a face to face consultation. Now, GPs are under enormous workload, but these are the terms of the job that they signed up for, and maybe a balance is now available where there's things like the pill, for example, which you still have to have a GP's appointment for, which seems a bit ridiculous to have to actually visit the GP, but all it does, the GPs are the gatekeepers for the NHS, and actually I've done this myself. When I can't get a GP's appointment, I've gone to A and E. Now, what pressure does that put under our NHS, it's not right, and therefore I think they should work face to face wherever possible.

[0:50:58] Man over there.
AudienceMember 20210930QT35
[0:50:59] I think the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, 56 per cent just betrays a complete misunderstanding of what the patients of his members want. They might not want 100 per cent face to face, but I'm pretty sure that it's a damn sight more than 56. If he thinks that 56 is about right, then he's very wrong.
Fiona Bruce
[0:51:22] So Grant, NHS England changed their guidance in May, which had been the COVID guidance, so that it was kind of triage system, so you didn't get…so a lot of appointments were remote. That was changed, but then actually GPs just carried on doing it remotely anyway.
Grant Shapps
[0:51:35] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I look, I entirely agree with the question and actually other panel members, people should have the ability to go and see their GP. There are many times where you might present with one issue, but a GP who's skilled will know that there may be some other underlying issue or ask you a question that leads you to go for a further check-up or whatever it is, so people should absolutely have that right ability…
Fiona Bruce
[0:51:57] So when you've got the Royal College of GPs saying it's just undeliverable to be able to have face to face appointments.

Grant Shapps
[0:52:01] No, no, no, how…when you think about that, how can that possibly be the case when before the pandemic they were managing to see virtually everybody face to face and figures were even higher than 80 per cent, I think most GPs didn't even offer a telephone or online service. So there's no reason why they can't go back to that. The NHS is in receipt of more money than at any other time, and actually, this could be one of the places where the world's changed through coronavirus a lot, and actually there are times, as somebody mentioned, where people might want to see…I can think of occasions where I might just want to phone or have an online appointment, and the fact that a few people do that should actually enable them to get through even more patients. There's no reason why people shouldn't be able to get that face to face and that must be where we end with this.

Fiona Bruce
[0:52:54] What do you mean, where's the money going?
AudienceMember 20210930QT37
[0:52:55] Well, you keep saying that there's money in the NHS and social care, for example, but where is that money going? There's no evidence where it's going to, and how are you funding things?
Fiona Bruce
[0:53:05] The man at the back in the pink shirt.
Male Aud 12
[0:53:08] As the general public, if you do not allow us to see GPs face to face, that's going to cost lives.
Fiona Bruce
[0:53:16] Well, that's the fear, isn't it? David Lammy.
David Lammy
[0:53:20] There was a problem before the pandemic, so I think it's important that people can see their GP face to face, but that's not going to solve the problem, because actually before the pandemic, some people were waiting weeks to see their GP, the pandemic has made it worse. How do you fix the problem? We have a shortage of doctors right across the country, and actually there are also issues around space and infrastructure, particularly for a lot of single-handed GPs, and you've got to fix those issues as well. I think it was NHS England that demonstrated that there've been a hell of a lot of missed diagnoses this year, over 20 thousand missed diabetes cases, pulmonary heart disease, heart failure…

Fiona Bruce
[0:54:04] It's 175 thousand diagnoses missed.
David Lammy
[0:54:05] …a whole set of things have been missed, and so for that reason, it does seem likely that because people couldn't sit in front of their GP, you know, your GP knows you, he knows your family over many years, can ask the right questions. That can't all be done online, it can't all be done on the phone, that seems obvious to me, but it's not as straightforward as just being able to get back to see your GP if you can't see your GP for four to six weeks, and for some practices, that was the case.
Fiona Bruce
[0:54:32] Woman in the glasses.
AudienceMember 20210930QT38
[0:54:33] Can I just add that my GP will see me face to face a lot, but there is one GP in our practice that if you do need to see them face to face, it's nearly impossible, and it all has to be done via the phone, which I think is wrong when people are saying that you can get in…supposed to be able to see the GP face to face.

[0:54:53] Kate.
Kate Andrews
[0:54:55] Yeah, it's great that now we can use remote contact with GPs to get a new prescription or deal with something very small, but that isn't really the point here. I'm pleased that we've moved into a world where that's possible, but the point is that for 18 months, patients have more or less been put off going to the NHS. It got so bad at the end of last year that the NHS had to come up with its own slogans to try to recruit people back to the NHS because we were worried about capacity, for understandable reasons, but it has meant that so many people have gone missed, over five million people now in England on these waiting lists, and if we owe any group of people anything, it is those who are sick and vulnerable and who did not get seen in a good amount of time, to be able to get all of the access to the care that they need now. And that has to start with being able to see your GP.

Kate Andrews
[0:55:40] Now, I don't pretend for a moment that that's easy, but GPs are earning somewhere between two to three times what your average earner in the UK is. They need to be back in the office and they need to see patients who want to be face to face, for those who already know that they're sick and can't get treatment, for those who don't know that they're sick yet, and for those who are just anxious and nervous about what might be down the road, we're talking in some cases about life or death. Surely after the year of COVID, year and a half of COVID, we now really understand what life and death means, and that shouldn't just apply to the virus, it should apply to every major illness, and those patients deserve the time and the treatment as well.
Fiona Bruce
[0:56:29] Yes.

[0:56:29] I think that trying to do a ten minute appointment is really tight, and maybe they could have a little bit more time as well.
Fiona Bruce
[0:56:36] So it's not only getting to see them, but seeing them for long enough. I mean, Grant Shapps, fewer than one in four GPs work full time, and that's a figure given by NHS England. The Conservative government has been talking…has had at least two go's at recruiting more GPs, actually we have fewer GPs now than we had in 2015. If you'd sorted that out, would that not have made this problem rather easier?

Grant Shapps
[0:56:53] Well, as…you know, as David says, there are shortages of people coming into the profession, I think, but I don't have the GP number per se. I know that the doctors and nurses numbers are up a lot [voices overlap 0:57:05].
Fiona Bruce
[0:57:05] There's a shortage of 2500 full time GPs, according to the King's Fund.
Grant Shapps
[0:57:10] Yeah, and look, I mean…
Fiona Bruce
[0:57:12] And there are almost two thousand fewer full time GPs now than in 2015.
Grant Shapps
[0:57:17] You've got some numbers there which I haven't seen, but I do know that overall doctors and nurses' numbers are significantly up, and actually unusually, I agree with…

Fiona Bruce
[0:57:23] But not GPs, which is what we're talking about here.
Grant Shapps
[0:57:25] Yeah, but the point I make is that we should be able to use the fact that they have been able to open up online services and there will be some people who are happy to do that, because it's convenient for their lives, to be able to see more people over any given day, and the fact that not enough GP services are opening up isn't acceptable, we absolutely think everybody has a right to see a GP face to face.
